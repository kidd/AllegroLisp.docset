name="allegro-directory-1">1.0 The Allegro directory</a></h2>

<p id="5">The <i>Allegro directory</i> is the directory where Allegro CL was
installed. In it is the executable (see
<a href="#executable-names-1">Section 2.0 Allegro CL Executables: alisp, alisp8, mlisp, mlisp8, allegro, allegro-ansi, allegro-express</a> below for executable
names) and one or more standard images (with extension <i>dxl</i> and
names the same as the executable names) and other files and
subdirectories which may be needed to run Allegro CL. If you follow
the standard installation procedure, the Allegro directory on Windows
machines is <i>C:\Program Files\aclNN</i> (where NN is the version number with the dots removed -- like 81, 82, 90) and on Unix is
<i>/usr/local/aclNN</i>.</p>


<p id="6">
Starting in version 9.0, Allegro CL is distributed in two forms: the
SMP version and the non-SMP version. Each has its own directory and
can be considered a separate distribution, just like Allegro CL 8.2
and Allegro CL 9.0 are separate distributions. <i>Allegro
directory</i> refers to the non-SMP directory when you are using the
non-SMP version and the SMP directory when you are using the SMP
version.
</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="7"><a name="executable-names-1">2.0 Allegro CL Executables: alisp, alisp8, mlisp, mlisp8, allegro, allegro-ansi, allegro-express</a></h2>

<p id="8">
Allegro CL comes in at least four
varieties, depending on the internal representation of strings and
characters (whether 16 or 8 bits per character), and the case mode
(whether ANSI or modern). Therefore, your distibution will have at
least the following executables and corresponding image (<i>dxl</i>)
files. Note too that on Windows, the executable files have extension
<i>.exe</i>, while on Unix, the executables have no extension.
</p>
<p id="9">
<b>Note for Express edition users</b>: On
UNIX platforms, only one executable/image is supplied. On all UNIX
platforms it is
<i>alisp</i>/<i>alisp.dxl</i> (ANSI supporting international
characters). A <i>readme</i> in the Allegro directory
tells you how to build other types of images (but only 16-bit images
can be built). On Windows, none of the four executables/images listed
next are supplied. Only
<i>allegro-express.exe</i>/<i>allegro-express.dxl</i>, described after the
bulleted list.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="10"><i>mlisp</i> (<i>mlisp.exe</i> on Windows): Common Lisp, modern
mode (case sensitive lower, supports international 16-bit characters).
Some Allegro CL-based products work better in this mode, AllegroServe
and Allegro ORBLink being two.</li> <li id="11"><i>mlisp8</i>
(<i>mlisp8.exe</i> on Windows): Common Lisp, modern mode (case
sensitive lower, uses 8-bit characters and cannot support
international character sets).</li> <li id="12"><i>alisp</i> (<i>alisp.exe</i>
on Windows): Common Lisp, ANSI mode (case insensitive upper, supports
international 16-bit characters).  Not all Allegro CL-based products
work well in this mode -- modern languages such as C, C++, and XML are
case sensitive, and supporting interfaces to these languages in a case
insensitive Lisp is difficult. This is a copy of <i>mlisp</i>
(<i>mlisp.exe</i> on Windows), renamed simply to start the image of
the same name (and extension dxl).
</li>
<li id="13"><i>alisp8</i> (<i>alisp8.exe</i> on Windows): Common Lisp, ANSI
mode (case insensitive upper, uses 8-bit characters and cannot support
international character sets). This is a copy of 
<i>mlisp8</i> (<i>mlisp8.exe</i> on Windows), renamed simply to start the
image of the same name (and extension dxl).
</li>
</ul>


<p id="14">
On Windows and on Linux using Intel x86 processors, there are two
additional executables: <i>allegro.exe</i> and
<i>allegro-ansi.exe</i>. Both are copies of
<i>mlisp.exe</i>, and so support 16-bit characters. They
are associated with images (same name, extension
<i>dxl</i>) that include the Common Graphics/IDE code
and, when invoked, start the IDE
automatically. <b>Allegro Express
users</b>: only one executable/image is supplied: <i>allegro-express.exe</i>/<i>allegro-express.dxl</i>, equivalent to
<i>allegro-ansi.exe</i>/<i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i> (ANSI with the IDE
supporting international characters). A
<i>readme.txt</i> in the Allegro directory tells you how
to build other types of images.) See <a href="cgide.htm#allegro-8bit-2">How to create an 8-bit image which starts the
IDE</a> in <a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a> for information on
building an 8-bit image that includes the IDE and invokes it on
startup.
</p>
<p id="15">
Allegro CL has always supported modern (case-sensitive, lowercase
preferred) mode, but, starting with release 6.0, a modern image and
executable are supplied. We believe the benefits of using modern mode
outweigh the slight inconveniences of porting case-insensitive code to
it.
</p>
<p id="16">
Allegro CL has also for some time supported international character
sets, but with a special, add-on version called International Allegro
CL. Starting in release 6.0, standard Allegro CL supports 16-bit
characters (and strings) and does not support 8-bit
characters. Because of automatic compatibility routines when loading
text files, most users who do not use international character sets
will not notice the change. However, some may (for example, users with
applications that manipulate very large ASCII strings) and those users
may wish to use the 8-bit versions. Note that a fasl file containing a
string constant compiled in the standard (16-bit) Lisp cannot be
loaded into the 8-bit version, but fasl files with string constants
compiled in the 8-bit version can be loaded into the standard version.
</p>
<p id="17">
Because of the multiplicity of executable names, we will refer to the
executable as <i>mlisp</i> in the document unless there is some reason
to refer to a different version.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="18"><a name="license-file-1">3.0 The Allegro CL license file</a></h2>

<p id="19">
Allegro CL uses a license file, <i>devel.lic</i> in the
Allegro directory. This file <i>must</i> be present and have proper
contents in order for Allegro CL to start. If the file is not present
or does not have the proper contents, Lisp fails to start with a
message like the following example from the Windows version, which
appears in a pop-up dialog. On UNIX, the message (with a different
path) appears in a shell window or in an Emacs buffer.
</p>
<pre id="20">
Missing or invalid license file (C:\Program Files\ACL81\devel.lic).
Lisp cannot start up.
</pre>
<p id="21">
Note that the name of the license must be
<i>devel.lic</i>. A valid file with a different name
will not work (but the fix is easy -- copy that file to
<i>devel.lic</i> in the Allegro directory).
</p>
<p id="22">
This license file is not included on the distribution CD (or as part
of the Express download). As described in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>, information on obtaining license
files is sent to Professional and Enterprise
customers. Express users obtain a license
file by following the instructions on the Franz Inc. website
(franz.com). If you do not have a license file or your license
file is not valid, please contact Franz Inc. See <a href="introduction.htm#where-to-send-bugs-2">Where to report
bugs and send questions</a> in
<a href="introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="23">
Along with allowing Allegro CL to start up, the license indicates
which add-on products and utilities are licensed, and prevents access
to unlicensed products and utilities. If you believe you are licensed
for a product or utility but the license file prevents you from using
it, again, contact Franz Inc. See <a href="introduction.htm#where-to-send-bugs-2">Where to report bugs and send
questions</a> in <a href="introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="24">
Here is what a license file looks like. It is a text file, but some of
the text (the actual license parts) is encrypted. This is a bogus
file, of course, with the encrypted portions much modified (and much
shortened). We provide it so you can see what a license file looks
like. This license file is used internally at Franz Inc. (as it
says). It also has an expiration
date. Express versions will have an
expiration date. Licensed versions (that is, to paying customers) have
no expiration date.

<hr><h2 id="27"><a name="starting-unix-2">4.1 Starting on UNIX machines</a></h2>

<p id="28">
The recommended way to start Lisp on UNIX machines is as a
subprocess of Emacs (Xemacs or GNU Emacs). However, Lisp may be
started from a shell. The disadvantage of starting Lisp from a shell
is that the editing and other features of the Emacs-Lisp interface are
not available. If you use Allegro Composer, you must run Lisp as a
subprocess of Emacs.
</p>

<p id="29">
The command for starting in a shell (assuming the Allegro directory is
in your PATH) is as follows. Note the -I argument, if specified, must
be first.
</p>

<pre id="30">
&gt; mlisp [-I &lt;image path and name&gt;.dxl] [other args]
</pre>

<p id="31">
See <a href="#command-line-args-1">Section 5.0 Command line arguments</a> for
information on starting under emacs and for information on
command-line arguments including the -I argument. See
<a href="#executable-names-1">Section 2.0 Allegro CL Executables: alisp, alisp8, mlisp, mlisp8, allegro, allegro-ansi, allegro-express</a> for the names of
executables other than <i>mlisp</i>.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="32"><a name="starting-unix-script-3">4.1.1 Starting on UNIX using a shell script</a></h2>





<p id="33">
Shell scripts only work on UNIX (not on Windows). See
<a href="#bat-file-3">Section 4.2.2 Starting on Windows using bat files</a> for information on starting
on Windows using a bat file.
</p>

<p id="34">
The UNIX feature of having a file that starts with
</p>
<pre id="35">
    #! &lt;program&gt; &lt;args&gt;
</pre>
<p id="36">
works with Allegro CL on some UNIX platforms (it does not work on
FreeBSD -- see <a href="#fbsd-note">FreeBSD note
below</a>). Here is the form:
</p>
<pre id="37">
    #! &lt;lisp-executable&gt; { -#D | -#C | #T | -#! }
</pre>
<p id="38">
Where:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="39">
&lt;lisp-executable&gt; is the name of the Allegro CL executable file.
Note: &lt;lisp-executable&gt; cannot itself be a shell script: it must
be one of the actual executable files, such as
<i>mlisp</i>.
<p id="40">
Further, on most platforms, the executable should be in a
directory which is in the PATH environment variable (despite the fact
that the full pathname of the file is specified in the script). 
</p>
<p id="41">
The reason the directory needs to be in PATH is that the Allegro CL
executable needs to find itself on startup (to do things like finding
its symbol table). However, most versions of UNIX seem to discard the
directory information in the script after finding the specified
executable, so Lisp itself has only the executable's filename to use
to find itself. (If the executable's location is in PATH, it is able
to find itself.) Note that certain versions of UNIX, such as Linux
with kernels greater than 2.4 and Solaris do keep the specified
executable's location information and on those platforms, it does not
seem to be necessary to have the location included in PATH.
</p>
<p id="42">
Initialization files are never read when Lisp is started with a
script. So Lisp is started as if the command-line argument
<b>--qq</b> was specified. See
<a href="#command-line-args-1">Section 5.0 Command line arguments</a> for information on
command-line arguments.
</p>
</li>
<li id="43">
<code>-#D</code> is used for debugging (a backtrace is
printed when an error occurs).
</li>
<li id="44">
<code>-#C</code> is used to have
the script compiled.
</li>
<li id="45">
<code>-#T</code> is like <code>-#C</code>, in that the
script is compiled, but the compiled script is placed in
<i>/tmp</i> rather than the directory containing the
script, and so the user need not have write permission in that
directory.
</li>
<li id="46">
<code>-#!</code> just loads the script.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="47">
Scripts run using #! that signal an error will exit with a non-zero exit
status.
</p>

<p id="48">
Here's an example. Put this in a file <i>hello_world.cl</i>.
We assume PATH includes <i>/usr/local/acl/</i>:
</p>
<pre id="49">
#! /usr/local/acl/mlisp -#!
(format t "Hello World!~%")
</pre>
<p id="50">
Then,
</p>
<pre id="51">
% chmod 755 hello_world.cl
% ./hello_world.cl
Hello World!
% 
</pre>

<p id="52">
Because different versions of UNIX handle shell scripts like these
differently, this method of starting Allegro CL may not work (it is
known not to work on FreeBSD, as noted below). Please test
the simple example before trying a more complex one.
</p>


<h3 id="53">
The script file path
</h3>
<p id="54">
The variable <a href="variables/excl/s_script-name_s.htm"><code>*script-name*</code></a> is bound to the name of
the script file being run when Allegro CL is being executed by a UNIX
script file.
</p>
<p id="55">
For example, consider this script file <i>test.cl</i>:
</p>

<pre id="56">
#! /fi/cl/bin/mlisp -#T
(format t "-#T ~a~%" *script-name*)
</pre>

<p id="57">
Here is that script being run:

<h3 id="59">
compile-file can skip the first line of a file being compiled

<p id="60">
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile-.htm"><b>compile-file</b></a> has an
additional (Allegro CL-only) keyword
argument <i>:script</i>. If true, the first line of the
file being compiled will be skipped if the first two characters
are <code>#!</code>. This allows a UNIX script file (whose first
line begin with those two characters) to be compiled and loaded as
ordinary Lisp files as well as being run as shell
scripts. See <a href="compiling.htm#compile-file-1">compile-file</a>

<hr><h2 id="66"><a name="starting-windows-2">4.2 Starting on Windows machines</a></h2>

<p id="67">
A typical way to run on Windows is with the Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). The IDE is discussed in
<a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>. Particularly see the section <a href="cgide.htm#startup-1">About IDE startup</a> for
information about IDE startup. Information is provided there about the
startup steps and about the IDE-specific files that are read on
startip (in addition to the .clinit.cl and siteinit.cl files common to
all Allegro CL images -- see <a href="#init-files-1">Section 13.0 Initialization and the sys:siteinit.cl and [.]clinit.cl files</a>).
</p>
<p id="68">
The rest of this section discusses general issues of starting on
Windows and starting without the IDE.
</p>
<p id="69">
There is an Allegro CL 10.1 menu item on
the Windows <b>All Programs</b> (the Start menu in earlier versions of
Windows). Choosing it displays a submenu, whose items include Modern
ACL images and ANSI ACL Images. These two display submenus with
various choices, the first submenu of modern (case-sensitive) images
and the second of ANSI (case-insensitive) images. On each, the item
`Allegro CL (w IDE)' starts Allegro CL with the IDE and starts the IDE
automatically.
</p>
<p id="70">
To start using Emacs, see
<a href="#acl-as-emacs-subprocess-1">Section 8.0 Running Lisp as a subprocess of Emacs</a>.  See
<a href="#command-line-args-1">Section 5.0 Command line arguments</a> for information on
command-line arguments, including the -I argument (which specifies the
image to use). See <a href="#executable-names-1">Section 2.0 Allegro CL Executables: alisp, alisp8, mlisp, mlisp8, allegro, allegro-ansi, allegro-express</a>
for the names of executables other than <i>mlisp.exe</i>.
</p>

<p id="71">
If you want to start without using a menu item, you can
choose Run from the start menu, then specify the executable file,
image file, and any additional needed or desired arguments (described in
<a href="#command-line-args-1">Section 5.0 Command line arguments</a>), like this:
</p>

<pre id="72">

<hr><h2 id="73"><a name="build-exe-3">4.2.1 Starting Allegro CL on Windows as a Console App</a></h2>

<p id="74">
You can start Allegro CL on Windows as a Console Application by using
the executable <i>build.exe</i> rather than
<i>mlisp.exe</i>. <i>build.exe</i> is a
WIN32 console application, whereas <i>mlisp.exe</i> is a
WIN32 Windows application. If you want to run a command-line oriented
version of Allegro CL, use <i>build.exe</i>.
</p>
<p id="75">
Note that there are issues with multiprocessing and
<i>build.exe</i>.  <i>build.exe</i>
sometimes cannot tell if input is available or if a process that is
waiting on input should wake up. For this reason, we recommend you do
not use <i>build.exe</i> with multiprocessing applications.
</p>
<p id="76">
Note further that <i>build.exe</i> does not accept the
arguments that begin with +. Command-line arguments are described in
<a href="#command-line-args-1">Section 5.0 Command line arguments</a>.

creating an application (see <a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a> or
<a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>), but that is time-consuming
and involves additional machinery that makes it not quick enough. You
can tell potential users to start Lisp and then load a particular
file, but users like simplicity. On UNIX, you can use a shell script
(see <a href="#starting-unix-script-3">Section 4.1.1 Starting on UNIX using a shell script</a> but shell
scripts do not work on Windows.
</p>
<p id="79">
A new facility on Windows allows using a Windows bat file to contain
Lisp forms, so the bat file will start Lisp, execute the forms, and
exit. The command-line arguments <b>--bat</b> and <b>--bat-pause</b>
tell Lisp that it is being executed in a bat file (they are ignored on
UNIX which does not support bat files). <b>--bat</b> executes the code
in the bat file and exits. <b>--bat-pause</b> executes the code and
then pauses until a user action such as hitting the Enter key (thus
allowing the user to examine information displayed in some fashion).
</p>
<p id="80">
You do not specify either of those arguments to a command line typed
directly to a command prompt, to the dialog displayed by <b>Start |
Run</b>, or in the command executed by a shortcut. (Doing so is not
illegal, it just serves no practical purpose.) Instead, the arguments
are used in the call invoking Lisp in the bat file. The arguments tell
Lisp to expect additional forms (which are specified later in the bat
file) and to exit immediately (<b>--bat</b>) or pause before exiting
(<b>--bat-pause</b>).
</p>
<p id="81">
The function <a href="operators/excl/lisp-to-bat-file.htm"><b>lisp-to-bat-file</b></a> creates a bat file from a
Lisp source file and arguments which specify the executable, the image
file, and other details. You should use this function to create the
bat file. The function works on all platforms even though the bat file
will only work on Windows. See the description of <a href="operators/excl/lisp-to-bat-file.htm"><b>lisp-to-bat-file</b></a> for further details and a
link to an example.
</p>

<h4 id="82">
Calling Lisp in a bat file is a feature added after the initial 8.0 release
</h4>
<p id="83">
The bat file facility
was implemented by a patch released approximately 1/17/2006. You must
have that patch to use this feature.

<hr><h2 id="84"><a name="executable-image-etc-files-2">4.3 The executable, the image, and additional files</a></h2>

<p id="85">Allegro CL requires at least two files: an executable, typical
extension exe, and an image file, typical extension <em>dxl</em>. The
executable is small and can be used with any dxl file (from the same
release and on the same platform). The <em>dxl</em> file is typically
much larger and contains information on the Lisp environment. (Note
that in earlier releases on Unix, the image file was executable.)</p>

<p id="86">You run the executable specifying a <em>dxl</em> file as an
argument (identified by the -I flag). If no <em>dxl</em> file is
specified, the executable looks for a <em>dxl</em> file in the same
directory as the executable (typically, the Allegro directory) and
with the same name. Therefore, if the executable is
<em>/usr/acl81/mlisp</em> and no <em>dxl</em> file is specified,
<em>/usr/acl81/mlisp.dxl</em> will be looked for and used if it is
present. If it is not present, the startup will fail (and a -I
argument must be specified in that case).</p>



<hr><h2 id="87"><a name="executable-image-names-2">4.4 The executable and image names</a></h2>

<p id="88">See <a href="#executable-names-1">Section 2.0 Allegro CL Executables: alisp, alisp8, mlisp, mlisp8, allegro, allegro-ansi, allegro-express</a> for the names
of all executables supplied with Allegro CL.  
The name of the standard
executable is <em>mlisp</em> on Unix and <em>mlisp.exe</em> on Windows
(<i>alisp</i> for express on UNIX and <i>allegro-express.exe</i> for
Express on Windows). Any executable can be copied to have any other
name and doing so is useful if you want it automatically associated
with an image file with that name. You should leave the executable in
the Allegro directory (where it was installed) because its
location serves as a pointer to the locations of files needed during
execution.</p>

<p id="89">The location of the executable is set when the software is
installed. Typically, your system administrator will know where
Allegro CL was installed (if you did not install the software
yourself). The image files have extensions <em>dxl</em>. One or more
are supplied with the distribution and are in the same directory as
the executable. Images can also be created with <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. Their location and name
depends on the arguments specified to those functions. It is not
necessary for the executable and the image to be in the same
directory. The -I command-line argument specifies the image file
to use and its value can contain directory information as well as the
name of the image file.</p>

<p id="90">In this manual, we typically assume that the name of the Allegro CL
executable is <em>mlisp</em> or <i>mlisp.exe</i>, as the example is on
Unix or on Windows, and the image <i>mlisp.dxl</i> or, on Windows when
using the IDE, <em>allegro.dxl</em> or
<i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i>. When the platform is not
explicit, either <em>mlisp</em> or <em>mlisp.exe</em> may be mentioned
and readers should mentally add or remove <em>.exe</em> as they are
working on Windows or on Unix. We also assume that the executable is
located in a directory that is in your PATH environment variable (that
means the image can be started by typing the image name without its
path).  You, of course, should use the executable name actually used
on your system and should include its path or not as appropriate.</p>



<hr><h2 id="91"><a name="argument-defaults-2">4.5 Argument defaults </a></h2>

<p id="92">
Values for command line arguments can be specified as a
resource. On Unix, this is done with the file <i>lisprc</i> in the
same directory as the executable. On Windows, the arguments are stored
in the executable. This feature is designed for applications. Using
resources is discouraged for general use.
</p>

<p id="93">
It has significant limitations; in particular, the arguments
specified in the resource are concatenated with those specified
directly on the command-line with the resource arguments first. That
is, the resource + arguments (Windows only) are processed, then the
command-line + (Windows only) arguments, then the resource -
arguments, and finally the command-line - arguments. Since the
first -I argument encountered is used and others are ignored, you
cannot override the resource -I argument if one is
specified. (Actually, on Unix, you can move the <i>lisprc</i> file but
on Windows, there is no such workaround.) </p>

<p id="94">
It is because of these limitations that using resources is discouraged
for general use.  We mention them here because if resources are used,
users may not get the behavior they expect and may not easily figure
out why. Resources are described in the document
<a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a>, in the section on <a href="delivery.htm#resources-2">Resources</a>. See that
document for information on determining whether resources are being
used and for information on specifying them for applications.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="95"><a name="command-line-args-1">5.0 Command line arguments</a></h2>

<p id="96">
A command line argument is specified after the executable name when
starting Lisp from a UNIX shell, in response to a question when
starting Lisp as a subprocess of Emacs, and in the Run dialog when
starting under Windows. You may specify any of the predefined
arguments described next and any other arguments you want. 
</p>
<p id="97">
The arguments specified may affect the startup procedure but in any
case, all specified arguments are available when the image is running
using operators like the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="98">
<a href="operators/system/command-line-arguments.htm"><b>command-line-arguments</b></a>:
returns a list of command-line arguments.
</li>
<li id="99">
<a href="operators/system/command-line-argument.htm"><b>command-line-argument</b></a>:
returns a specific command-line argument.
</li>
<li id="100">
<a href="operators/system/command-line-argument-count.htm"><b>command-line-argument-count</b></a>:

binds variables to the values of specific command-line arguments
during the execution of the macro body.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="102">
It is not necessary to specify any arguments when running Allegro CL
so long as the dxl file has the same name and is in the same directory
as the executable file or has its name and location stored in the
executable file. If the dxl file has a different name or is in a
different directory and is not specified in the executable file, it
must be identified by a -I argument.
</p>

<p id="103">Command-line arguments are prefixed with a plus (+) or a minus
(-). Those prefixed with a plus (+) are for Windows only. Those
prefixed with a minus (-) are for all platforms.</p>

<p id="104">The general form for command line arguments on Windows is (it
should be all on one line but we have broken the line for ease of
reading). Note the -I argument, if specified, must be first among all
arguments starting with a -.
</p>

<pre id="105">

because of its special importance.</p>

<p id="107">On UNIX, the general form of the command-line, shown here when
starting from a shell, is</p>

<p id="109">
-: (controlling how the Allegro CL shared object file is to be looked
for) must be specified first, if supplied. When starting in Emacs, you
are asked for a `Lisp Image (dxl) file' and also for `Image arguments
(separated by spaces)'. The image (value of the <b>-I</b> argument)
should be specified to the first question and any remaining
command-line arguments in answer to the second. </p>

<p id="110"><i>acl-arguments</i> affect how Lisp is
run. <i>application-arguments</i> have no direct effect on Lisp but
are available once Lisp starts up. A double minus (`--') separates the
<em>acl-arguments</em> from the
<em>application-arguments</em>. Everything before the double minus is
interpreted as an <em>acl-argument</em>; everything after is
interpreted as an <em>application-argument</em>.  Therefore, the same
value can appear in either place (or in both places) without
ambiguity. If an argument before the -- is unrecognized by Allegro CL,
a warning is printed. </p>

<p id="111">
<em>application-arguments</em> (and <em>acl-arguments</em> as well)
are available after Lisp starts up with the function <a href="operators/system/command-line-arguments.htm"><b>command-line-arguments</b></a> and its relatives. We
will not say more about <em>application-arguments</em> here. See the
discussion of command-line arguments in <a href="os-interface.htm#command-line-arguments-1">Accessing

<a href="os-interface.htm">os-interface.htm</a>. See also <a href="operators/system/with-command-line-arguments.htm"><b>with-command-line-arguments</b></a>, which is a
macro that can be used to process command-line arguments (and can be
useful for processing application command-line arguments).
</p>

<p id="112">
Now to <em>acl-arguments</em>. The following tables show the arguments
and describe their effects. The first table describes the arguments

<ol>
<li id="143">
All arguments, including <b>-e form</b>, <b>--ee form</b>, and <b>-L
file</b>, are read and processed in order. Reading of one
-e/--ee form can depend on previous forms having been evaluated and
previous -L files having been loaded. For example, if the package
<code>mypack</code> is defined in <i>file.fasl</i>, the
following will not fail:
<pre id="144">
-L file.fasl -e (mypack::myfun)
</pre>
<p id="145">because the <code>mypack</code> package has been defined 
when the reader encounters <strong>mypack::myfun</strong>
(since <em>file.fasl</em> has been loaded).
</p>
</li>
<li id="146">
  Some global variables are not set as expected at the time arguments
  are processed. For example, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> is set to the (read-only)
  system readtable. You can modify such values but it requires extra
  work. See <a href="implementation.htm#readtable-2">The
  standard readtable is read-only, affect on with-standard-io-syntax
  and modifying the readtable in init files and with -e</a>
  in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>, where it shows how to
  modify <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> in an init file using a
  method that also applies also to -e, -ee, and -L.
</li>
<li id="147">
When Lisp is started as a subprocess of Emacs, the system adds the
arguments <code>-e (start-emacs-lisp-interface t)</code> as the
first arguments after the image name. Your own <b>-e/--ee</b>
arguments are not affected by this since multiple -e's are permitted,
but the emacs-supplied arguments will appear along with the image name
under the `command' column in the information printed by the Unix
<b>ps</b> command.
</li>

<li id="148">
It may not be possible to recover from an error signaled during the
evaluation of a -e form or the loading of a -L file (indeed, Lisp may
exit without giving you the opportunity to recover). Even if you are
presented with a prompt to type to, many top-level commands may not be
available. Restarting the image with the form corrected is the
recommended action.
</li>
<li id="149">
When running in batch mode, if an error occurs, Lisp exits with error
code 1. If an EOF is encountered, Lisp exits with error code 0.
</li>
<li id="150">
This argument
(--backtrace-on-error)
is designed for use with --batch. It
can be used with a non-batch image, but a backtrace is printed
whenever an error occurs and most users find this annoying. A
backtrace can be printed. The file <em>&lt;allegro
directory&gt;/src/autozoom.cl</em> defines a macro
<b>with-autozoom-and-exit</b> which can be wrapped around code where
programmers want to force a backtrace (and the backtrace can be
directed to any stream, not just <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/debug-io.htm"><code>*error-output*</code></a>). That macro is much
more appropriate for non-batch programs.
</li>
</ol>




<h4 id="151">
<a name="spec-ee-note"></a>Further description of the -e and --ee command-line arguments
</h4>

<blockquote>


<p id="152">
Both <b>-e</b> and <b>--ee</b>
take a form as a companion argument, The problem with the -e argument
is that certain characters, such as the space charcater, might be part
of the form or it might be a delimiter indicating the start of a new
command-line argument. The system has difficulty distinguishing those
cases.
</p>
<p id="153">
The traditional way to get around that problem is to escape such
characters, typically with a \ (backslash), or to wrap the companion
argument is single or double quotes. Suppose, for example, you want to
evaluate the form <code>(setq foo 10)</code> at startup. In
answer to the 'Image arguments' question asked by
<b>fi:common-lisp</b> (the Emacs function to start Allegro CL),
you could put:
</p>
<pre id="154">
  -e (setq\ foo\ 10)
</pre>
<p id="155">
And starting Lisp as a shell prompt, you might do
</p>
<pre id="156">
% mlisp -e '(setq foo 10)'
</pre>
<p id="157">
These solutions generally work, but the escaping becomes more
complicated with more complex forms. Further, when writing shell
scripts to start Allegro CL, the shell processing may undo the escapes
at the wrong time so when the argument is actually read, the
characters that need escapes no longer have them.
</p>
<p id="158">
The <b>--ee</b> argument is designed to get around that problem. When a
<b>--ee form</b> argument
is processed, the companion argument is scanned for character triplets
of the form <b>%hh</b>, when <b>hh</b> is a pair of Hex numbers
(0-9abcdef). Every <b>%hh</b> triplet is replaced by the character
whose <b>char-code</b> is <b>hh</b>. Then the companion argument is
processed.
</p>
<p id="159">
Frequently used codes include:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="160">
#\( -- code %28
</li>
<li id="161">
#\) -- code %29
</li>
<li id="162">
#\: -- code %3a
</li>
<li id="163">
#\space -- code %20
</li>
<li id="164">
#\% -- code %25
</li>
</ul>
<p id="165">
The (setq foo 10) argument could then be passed
</p>


<pre id="166">
--ee %28setq%20foo%2010%29
</pre>
<p id="167">
or
</p>
<pre id="168">
% mlisp --ee '%28setq%20foo%2010%29'
</pre>

<p id="169">
Thus the notation allows Lisp forms to be passed as a single OS token
unaffected by command line parsing or substitutions.
</p>
<p id="170">
The function <a href="operators/excl/make-escaped-string.htm"><b>make-escaped-string</b></a> takes a Lisp form (as a
string) and returns a properly converted string where the characters
that need to be escaped are replaced with the appropriate %hh triple.
</p>
<p id="171">
Note that only characters with <b>char-code</b>s less that 256 can be
represented.

<h4 id="172">
<a name="specnote-in-3.0"></a>Special note on the -! command-line argument
</h4>

<blockquote>
<p id="173">If this argument is specified, it must appear
<em><strong>first</strong></em> among the command-line arguments. This
argument is typically used when using a C-based debugger like
<strong>gdb</strong>. It should never be used in ordinary
circumstances because it causes certain kinds of error which are
typically not fatal to become fatal errors.</p>

<p id="174">The -! command-line argument is designed to assist in using an
external debugger. The primary effect of this switch is to prevent
lisp from catching illegal memory references and turning them into
calls to the segmentation violation handler. Because these bad
references are not caught, the exception generated by the operating
system will be passed to whatever program is controlling lisp (usually
a C Debugger). Note that if there is no program controlling Lisp, then
the operating system will put up a dialog box announcing the exception
and Lisp will not be able to continue. A secondary effect is to
start up in a more verbose mode.</p>

(<em>.so</em> or <em>.sl</em> files on Unix, <em>.dll</em> files on

<hr><h2 id="188"><a name="files-lisp-needs-two-2">6.2 Files Lisp needs to start up 2: the Allegro directory</a></h2>

<p id="189">The Allegro directory is a directory that contains files Lisp may
need to start up and while it is running. Because it needs files like
the <em>.pll</em> file, Lisp may fail on startup if it cannot find
this directory. The Allegro directory also refers to the directory
where Allegro CL was installed off the CD. We used the same name
because they are typically the same directory.</p>

<p id="190">The <em>.pll</em> filename is stored in the image, either as just a
filename, just a filename and type, or a filename (with or without a
type) with directory information. If directory information is
supplied, the pll file is looked for in that location only (using
default type pll if no type is specified), relative to the current
directory if the directory information is relative. No other location
is searched in that case. If the pll file information in the image
file is just a filename or filename and type, it is searched for in
the current directory and then in the Allegro directory, and then, on
Windows only, in the Windows systems directory. See <a href="operators/excl/pll-file.htm"><b>pll-file</b></a>.</p>

<p id="191">Unless the -H command-line argument is specified, the Allegro
directory is assumed to be the directory containing the executable
(the file, initially <em>mlisp.exe</em> on Windows and <em>mlisp</em> on
Unix). Files that may be needed for running may be in that directory
or in the <em>code/</em> subdirectory. If -H is specified, the
files must be in the directory specified. The structure of that
directory should mimic the structure of the Allegro directory (that
is, it should have a <em>code/</em> subdirectory and files should be
placed in the same relative locations as they are in the Allegro
directory.</p>

<p id="192">(In the 4.3.x releases on Unix, this directory was found using an
environment variable named ALLEGRO_CL_HOME. That was necessary because
the image file was executable and could be located anywhere, including
a user's home directory. Now that the image is separate from the
executable, the location of the executable can serve as a reference
point for finding other needed files. The image can still be anywhere,
including users' home directories. Earlier releases on Windows such as
3.0.x always used the separate executable and image model and always
used the executable location to find needed files.)</p>

<p id="193">Once Lisp finds the Allegro directory, it sets the translation of
the logical host <em>sys</em>
(i.e <code>(translate-logical-pathname "sys:")</code>) to be
that directory. That directory contains most of the files Lisp needs
to start up. It may happen that the directory identified as the
Allegro directory exists but is incorrect (that is, does not actually
contain the files Lisp needs). Lisp will fail to start if it needs
a <em>.pll</em> file but cannot find it in the current directory or
identified Allegro directory. Other missing files may cause problems
as well, but Lisp usually gets some way into the startup
process. Dealing with an existing but misidentified Allegro directory
is much like dealing with a non-existent one: find where the Allegro
directory really is and communicate this information to Lisp.</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="194"><a name="startup-message-1">7.0 The start-up message</a></h2>

<p id="195">When Lisp starts up, it prints

</p>

<p id="213">To start Allegro CL within Emacs, enter the following:</p>

<pre id="214">
M-x fi:common-lisp
</pre>

<p id="215">(M-x means depress the `x' key while the Meta key is down or press
the Escape key and then press the x key.) Emacs will ask 6
questions:</p>


<ol>
<li id="216">
<strong>Buffer</strong>: what the buffer in which Lisp will run should
be named. The default is the value of the Emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-buffer-name</code>, whose value is
typically *common-lisp*.
</li>
<li id="217">
<strong>Host</strong>: the name of the machine where Lisp will
run. The default is the value of the Emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-host</code>.
</li>
<li id="218">
<strong>Process directory</strong>: the directory in which to run Lisp
(if you were running from the shell, this is the directory in which
Lisp is started). The default is the value of the Lisp variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-directory</code>. This directory will be the one
returned by <a href="operators/excl/current-directory.htm"><b>current-directory</b></a> and the initial
value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/default-.htm"><code>*default-pathname-defaults*</code></a> after Lisp starts.
</li>
<li id="219">
<strong>Executable Image Name</strong>: the name of the Lisp
executable. This is a small file. Its name has no extension on UNIX and
has extension (type) <i>exe</i> on Windows.
Various executable files are shipped with the Allegro CL distribution.
The file itself is not typically created or modified at customer sites.
<p id="220">
There are two distinct executable files and often several copies of
each. One executable file uses 16-bit characters (copies are named,
for example, <i>mlisp/mlisp.exe</i> and
<i>alisp/alisp.exe</i>). The other uses 8-bit characters
(copies are named, for example, <i>mlisp8/mlisp8.exe</i>
and <i>alisp8/alisp8.exe</i>). On Windows and Linux on
Intel x86 processors, there is also <i>allegro.exe</i>
and <i>allegro-ansi.exe</i>. The filename is used to
determine the image name (so <i>mlisp/mlisp.exe</i>
looks for the image file <i>mlisp.dxl</i>, and so on).
</p>
<p id="221">
The default is the value
of the Emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-image-name</code>. (The name is historic:
in earlier versions the executable file and the image file were the
same.  Now they are different. The variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-image-file</code> has the image file as its
value.)
</p>
</li>
<li id="222">
<strong>Image</strong>: the name of the Lisp image (.dxl) file.  The
default is the value of the Emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-image-file</code>. (Note that, for historic
reasons, the emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-image-name</code> names the executable
file.)  If this argument is not specified, its value is assumed to be
the file in the same directory as the executable image name with the
same name but with extension .dxl. Thus, if Executable Image Name is
<i>mlisp</i>, the file <i>mlisp.dxl</i>
in the same directory of <i>mlisp</i> will be looked for if
this argument is unspecified.
</li>
<li id="223">
<strong>Image arguments</strong>: the command line arguments described
above. Since they are separated by spaces, you must use appropriate
quotation marks or backslashes if your arguments contains spaces (it
may take several tries to get it right). The default is the value of
the Emacs variable
<code>fi:common-lisp-image-arguments</code>. Enter nothing if
you want no arguments.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="224">
All questions are asked in the Emacs minibuffer. Once you have
answered all the questions, Lisp is started according to your
specifications.
</p>
<p id="225">
You can write your own Emacs function to call fi:common-lisp with your
desired values (and thus avoid having to input values). See <a href="eli.htm#funs-and-vars-for-interacting-2">Functions and
variables for Interacting with a CL subprocess</a> in
<a href="eli.htm">eli.htm</a> for examples of such functions.
</p>
<p id="226">
<strong>Warning</strong>: you must exit Lisp before quitting Emacs or
killing the Common Lisp buffer. Doing either without exiting Lisp may
leave the Lisp process running. Starting Lisp again from within Emacs
after you have killed a *common-lisp* buffer without exiting from Lisp
may result in Emacs being connected to the wrong running image.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="227"><a name="lisp-within-emacs-second-time-2">8.2 Starting Lisp within Emacs after the first time</a></h2>

<p id="228">Emacs remembers your answers to the questions asked by
fi:common-lisp so if you evaluate fi:common-lisp again (after killing
off the first Lisp image for whatever reason), Emacs will use the old
answers without asking again. If you want the questions asked again
(because, e.g. you want to run on a different host or with different
initial arguments), use the universal argument (typically C-u) before
M-x fi:common-lisp. Thus:</p>

<pre id="229">
C-u M-x fi:common-lisp

The defaults will be your previous set of answers. 
</p>

<p id="231"><strong>Warning</strong>: if the cursor is at the end of the
*common-lisp* buffer and superkeys are enabled, C-u will be
interpreted as `delete back to the last CL prompt' rather than as
universal argument. If Lisp is not running in the buffer and you enter
C-u at the end of the buffer, Emacs will print </p>

<pre id="232">
Wrong type of argument: processp, nil
</pre>

<p id="233">in the minibuffer. To get C-u interpreted as universal argument in
this case, go up a line (with previous-line, typically C-p) where C-u
will then be interpreted as universal argument:</p>

<hr><h2 id="245"><a name="using-ide-with-emacs-2">8.4 Using the IDE with Emacs</a></h2>

<p id="246">Windows only. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a
collection of graphical tools for building a graphical interface to an
application developed in Allegro CL. It provides editors and editing
capability. However, users familiar with Emacs may prefer to use
Emacs.</p>

<p id="247">The complication of using the IDE and Emacs is that all evaluation
of IDE-related code that receives events (mouse input of any sort and
keyboard input to a dialog) must be done by the IDE. This is because
all IDE-related events must happen within the IDE thread (see the
document <a href="multiprocessing.htm">multiprocessing.htm</a>). Emacs
runs in a separate thread. IDE-associated events cannot be initiated
by the Emacs thread (it is an error to do so). Thus, function
definitions etc. can be done within emacs. But code that displays
dialogs and handles events must be run within the IDE thread using IDE
tools.</p>

<p id="248">
When using the IDE, specify <i>allegro.dxl</i> or
<i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i> as the Image file.

<hr><hr><h2 id="249"><a name="starting-from-shell-1">9.0 Starting Lisp from a shell</a></h2>

<p id="250">You can start Lisp from a shell prompt or a DOS prompt. Assuming on

<p id="255">A Lisp started from a shell on UNIX will not benefit from the
Emacs-Lisp interface and many features of Allegro Composer will not
work.</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="256"><a name="start-up-problems-1">10.0 Start-up problems</a></h2>

<p id="257">
Generally, there are not many problems with start-up. If there is
insufficient swap space to run Lisp, a message saying so will be
printed and Lisp will not start.  Insufficient swap space may be a
temporary problem but if you often are prevented from starting for
that reason, you should consider increasing the swap space on your
machine (see the operating system's System Administration manual for
information on increasing swap space).
</p>

<p id="258">
Most errors during startup cause Lisp to fail (it prints the error
message). The exceptions include errors during the loading of an
initialization file and failure to find a loaded .so file. Those
errors produce warnings but do not prevent the startup procedure from
continuing. Other errors cause failure. Usually, the cause is
something added to the startup procedure (perhaps by a -e command line
argument or an item on <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-actions_s.htm"><code>*restart-actions*</code></a>). The recommended action is
to try to start again without the -e arguments or to use -e arguments to
set the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-actions_s.htm"><code>*restart-actions*</code></a> to <code>nil</code> (perhaps first making it the value of another
variable which can be examined after startup succeeds).
</p>

<p id="259">Other potential problems include the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li id="260">The Emacs-Lisp interface does not start. 
  See the information under the heading 
  <a href="#emacs-lisp-doesnt-start-2">Section 8.3 What if the Emacs-Lisp interface does not start?</a> above.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li id="261">The Allegro directory location cannot be found or necessary files cannot be found.
    Finding the Allegro directory is rarely a problem since it is typically the same directory
    as the executable (.exe) file. (The -H command-line argument can be used to specify a
    different location and startup may fail if that location does not exist, however.) Lisp
    may also fail to start because needed files are not in the Allegro directory. </li>
</ul>

<hr><hr><h2 id="262"><a name="exit-lisp-1">11.0 How to exit Lisp</a></h2> 

<p id="263">
The ANSI spec is silent on the question of how to exit
Lisp. Allegro CL has several commands which will cause a Lisp session
to terminate. The expression 
</p>

<pre id="264">
(<a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a>)
</pre>

<p id="265">will cause the current Lisp image to exit. </p>

<p id="266">
One can also exit Lisp directly from the top level, using the
top-level command <a href="tpl-commands/exit.htm"><b>:exit</b></a>,
documented in <a href="top-level.htm">top-level.htm</a>. These operators behave
somewhat differently according to whether the Lisp is running
multiprocessing or not. If there are multiple processes running, the
user may be concerned that these processes exit cleanly (with windows
cleaned up, for example).
</p>

<p id="267">
The functions used for exiting have options which allow for clean
exits in each process, but the user should be aware that if some
problem occurs, user intervention may be necessary to correct it, and
it may take some time for the problem to manifest itself. You may have
to respond to questions (about, for example, whether certain processes
should indeed be killed) before exiting completes. If you are running
on Windows using the IDE (see <a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>), you will
usually have to confirm the exit by clicking <b>Yes</b> on a modal
dialog asking if you really want to exit Lisp, and, often, also
indicate whether unsaved files should be saved.
</p>

<p id="268">
The top level command may not exit if there are other processes
running, and the function <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a> called without arguments will try to
clean up all processes that are running. Users using multiprocessing
should read the description of the <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a> function.  (The Emacs-Lisp interface uses
multiprocessing. However, processes created by that interface, or by
Allegro Composer, are generally well-behaved with respect to exit
behavior. Problems typically arise with user-created processes.)
</p>

<hr><h2 id="269"><a name="exit-for-sure-2">11.1 How to exit for sure</a></h2>

<p id="270">
If a simple call to (<a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a>) does not cause Lisp to exit (typically
because of problems with multiple processes), try the following
form:
</p>

<pre id="271">
(excl:exit 0 :no-unwind t :quiet t)
</pre>

<p id="272">
The <i>no-unwind</i> argument, when <code>t</code>, tells Lisp to try to exit without unwinding
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unwind-p.htm"><b>unwind-protect</b></a>'ed
forms. The <i>quiet</i> argument suppresses output
(which might cause a problem in an
Emacs <code>*background-interaction*</code> buffer).
</p>

<p id="273">
The exit code (first argument) 0 is important, at least on Windows. A
non-zero exit code may keep the Lisp console on Windows from
exiting. See <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a> for
more information.

<p id="275">In this section, we describe the Allegro CL startup
procedure. While this is usually of academic interest only, if the
startup does not go as expected, the reason may be that things are
done in a different order than you expect. See the file
<i>src/aclstart.cl</i> (in the Allegro directory), which
contains the source to the startup code. </p>

<ol>
<li id="276">
<strong>The initial value of <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is set</strong>. (See <a href="iacl.htm#initial-locale-2">The initial locale when Allegro

</li>
<li id="277">
<strong>All logical pathnames translations are flushed</strong>. 
The translations may have been defined in the parent image (particularly 
if the image was created with 
<a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> after the

</li>
<li id="281">
<strong>Loaded .so (.sl, .dll) files are
reloaded</strong>. Shared object files are mapped into a running
image, not built into the executable image. therefore, all such
files must be reloaded on startup. Under certain circumstances,
the image may not be able to find these files. If it cannot find a
.so file, a warning is printed but no error is signaled. If Lisp
gets to the first prompt without error, the missing .so file can
usually be loaded at that time.

<strong>Command-line

</li> 
<li id="283">
<strong>Initialization files are
read</strong>. The files are <em>sys:siteinit.cl</em>, the two
user initialization files. Whether the files are read and exactly
which files are read depends on the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_read-init-files_s.htm"><code>*read-init-files*</code></a> and the
command-line arguments. If any initialization files are read,
<em>sys:siteinit.cl</em> is read first. If both user
initialization files are read, the one in the home directory is
read first. Errors that occur reading the files are ignored. If an
error occurs in a file, the remainder of the file is ignored. User
initialization files are named by the variable <a href="variables/excl/s_init-file-names_s.htm"><code>*init-file-names*</code></a>.  The

<p id="295">One thing we want to emphasize by detailing the startup sequence is
that because of the order, certain things cannot affect other
things. Trivially, a command-line argument can affect whether and
which init files are read but an init file cannot affect command-line
processing. Note the following about the startup procedure: </p>

<ul>
  <li id="296">The source code for the startup procedure is in <em>&lt;Allegro
    directory&gt;/src/aclstart.cl</em>. That file can be examined for more details of starting
    up.</li>
  <li id="297">The steps 2-11 are run within a handler-case form. If an unhandled error occurs during
    startup, a message is printed and Lisp exits. The acts of reading the init files and
    reloading loaded .so files are protected against errors so problems there do not cause
    unhandled errors.</li>
  <li id="298">Step 11 provides a backdoor hook into Lisp via an environment variable. In some cases,
    this hook can be used to force a startup which is failing. If, for example, <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>
    is causing problems, but init files are not read and command-line arguments are ignored
    (two other ways to affect startup), starting Lisp in an environment where ACL_STARTUP_HOOK
    is "(setq *restart-app-function* nil)", Lisp will start a Lisp listener
    instead of calling <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>.

on the command line, the<i> [.]clinit.cl</i> in your home directory

<hr><hr><h2 id="327"><a name="setting-globals-1">14.0 Setting global variables in initialization files</a></h2> 

<p id="328">Allegro CL starts a Lisp listener by binding many standard Common
Lisp special variables and also many Allegro-CL-specific special
variables to appropriate values. The listener runs within the scope of
these bindings. Allegro CL does this because it implements a
multiprocessing extension. The bindings permit one process to set a
special without another process being affected. (For example, if a
process doing output sets *print-base* to 8 in order to print out
octal numbers, the Lisp listener, running concurrently and trying to
print the integer nine, will print 9 rather than 11.) Even if you are
running Lisp without initiating multiprocessing, the Listener runs
within the scope of the bindings.</p>

<hr><h2 id="329"><a name="bindings-defined-2">14.1 Where are the bindings defined?</a></h2>

<p id="330">
A Lisp listener gets its bindings from three alists: <a href="variables/excl/s_required-thread-bindings_s.htm"><code>*required-thread-bindings*</code></a>,

</p>
<p id="331">
<a href="variables/excl/s_required-thread-bindings_s.htm"><code>*required-thread-bindings*</code></a> is not relevant to
this discussion unless its initial value is changed, since the only
entry involving an exported symbol is (*readtable* . *readtable*),
binding the value of *readtable* to its global value. And then
*readtable* is again bound by the <a href="variables/excl/s_required-top-level-bindings_s.htm"><code>*required-top-level-bindings*</code></a> alist. So we
will just discuss the remaining two alists.
</p>
<p id="332">

</p>

<pre id="333">

<p id="335">Notice that most of the entries in <a href="variables/excl/s_required-top-level-bindings_s.htm"><code>*required-top-level-bindings*</code></a> associate a
variable with a specific value such as t (the value associated with
*print-pretty* and *print-escape*) or 10 (the value associated with
*print-base*) or nil (the value associated with *print-length*,
*print-level*, and *print-radix* -- the <code>nil</code>
isn't printed because in an alist, (*print-escape* . nil) and
(*print-escape*) are the same thing). The only pair shown which does
not use a specific value is <code>(*READTABLE* COPY-READTABLE
NIL)</code>, which says make the value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> a copy of the initial readtable. If
you look at the entire list you will see further entries that are
associated with the value of a variable or a more complex form to
evaluate (as with *readtable*). Most of the entries in
<a href="variables/tpl/s_default-lisp-listener-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-lisp-listener-bindings*</code></a>
associate variables with values of variables, but notice many of them
are unexported.
</p>

<p id="336">
The variables associated with specific values will be bound to
those values when a Lisp listener is started regardless of the actual
value of the variable at the time the binding is done. This means that
setting (with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setq.htm"><b>setq</b></a>) the value of such a variable in
an initialization file (or anywhere prior to a Lisp listener being
started) cannot affect the binding in effect within the listener. To
be concrete, suppose the following form is in your <em>.clinit.cl</em>
file and that file is read on Lisp startup:</p>

<pre id="337">
(setq *print-length* 20)
</pre>

<p id="338">If you evaluate <code>*print-length*</code> in the listener that
appears after startup, you get:</p>

<pre id="339">
USER(1): *print-length*
NIL

<p id="340">Why? Because the listener sets the binding of
<code>*print-length*</code> to <code>nil</code>, as called
for in <a href="variables/excl/s_required-top-level-bindings_s.htm"><code>*required-top-level-bindings*</code></a>. The value set
in the initialization file is ignored. </p>

<p id="342">You change the alist from which the bindings are drawn so that the
binding is made to the value you want. (You could also remove the
entry from the alist so that the value is not bound when a listener is
started, but that is not recommended.) The macro <a href="operators/tpl/setq-default.htm"><b>tpl:setq-default</b></a> is designed to do
exactly that. The form</p>

      If it is, it replaces the value of the pair with

<p id="367">
For interrupting on UNIX, see <a href="#enough-cc-s-2">here</a>, for interrupting on Windows,
see <a href="#allegro-icon-2">here</a>.
</p>

<p id="368">
At times, the system may seem to `hang', that is make no response
to what you have typed and seem to be doing nothing. This may be
normal, since some commands take a long time to execute, or it may
indicate that the system has gone into some loop or received improper
input. </p>

<p id="369">If you are running in a shell, a common cause is unclosed
parentheses in the input line. Try adding some closing parentheses and
see if that helps -- too many right parentheses will signal a warning
but not an error. (If you are running under Emacs, it should be clear
that parentheses are missing because the cursor will be indented since
Emacs expects more information.)</p>

<p id="370">If too few right parentheses is not the problem, try to regain
control by hitting the Unix interrupt character (user-settable but
typically C-c in the shell and C-c C-c in Emacs). Entering this
character sends signal #2 (SIGINT) to the Lisp process. Allegro CL
checks for a keyboard interrupt at almost every function call and at
least once in each iteration of a loop compiled at proper safety, and
this method will typically work.  However, it will not work in two
cases: (1) when Lisp is executing foreign code (if the infinite loop
is in C or FORTRAN code loading into Lisp) and (2) when Lisp is
executing a function compiled so that interrupt checks are suppressed
(it is possible to set the compiler options so that this check is not
made in user defined compiled functions, 
see <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>). 
</p>



<hr><h2 id="371"><a name="enough-cc-s-2">15.4 Enough C-c's (on Unix) will always interrupt</a></h2>

<p id="372">Often, a Control-C will interrupt on Unix (C-c C-c if using
Emacs). If a single Control-C does not work, after 5 SIGINTs (C-c in a
shell, C-q C-c when running Lisp under Emacs) will cause Lisp to be
interrupted with a non-continuable error (a single SIGINT triggers a
continuable error).</p>

<p id="373">Note we say `C-q C-c' when in the Emacs-Lisp interface. Typically,
C-c C-c sends a SIGINT to Lisp when running in Emacs. However, that
sends it through the interface, and the interface will not process
things while Lisp is in an infinite loop. C-q C-c cause the SIGINT to
go directly to Lisp.</p>

<p id="374">Warnings will be printed after 3 and 4 interrupts have been
received, telling you that 2 more (after 3) or 1 more (after 4) will
cause Lisp to signal a non-continuable error.</p>

<p id="375">Lisp can do this because in fact, SIGINTs are recorded whenever
they occur, but Lisp does not do anything until an appropriate moment
(typically, at the beginning of a function call, unless the function
was compiled in such a way as to suppress that check).  If 5 SIGINTs
are recorded without being handled, Lisp will now interrupt for
sure. It does not matter when these SIGINTs happen (in foreign or Lisp
code compiled in any fashion) except garbage collections will not be
interrupted. </p>

<p id="376">We chose five because users often enter several interrupts to
interrupt a program, and we did not want normal behavior to trigger a
non-continuable error. With the warnings mentioned above, we do not
believe that users will unintentionally enter five interrupts without
really wanting to break into the Lisp process.</p>

<p id="377">Users should be warned that it is possible for an interrupt
generated by 5 SIGINTs to leave the stack in a corrupted state. When
you break into Lisp in this fashion, you should immediately enter :pop
or :reset to try to clear the stack. In some cases, Lisp may not be
able to recover. (Almost all those cases happen when foreign code is
called with the <em>call-direct</em> argument to <a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a> -- see 
<a href="foreign-functions.htm">foreign-functions.htm</a>. Please note
that some Franz code, particularly CLIM code, calls foreign code using
<em>call-direct</em>. We have done several things to ensure Lisp is
not corrupted even when the break occurs in a <em>call-direct</em>,
but failure is a possibility.) However, it is likely that you will be
able to recover (and recovery was typically not possible in earlier
versions when an infinite loop was entered).</p>

<p id="378">Users have tried (with more or less success) to break into Lisp
from another shell by sending a Signal 4 or Signal 11 to the Lisp
process. This can still be done (with the same success rate) but note
that only SIGINTs (Signal 2) are recorded as counting to the 5
necessary to break for sure.</p>



<hr><h2 id="379"><a name="allegro-icon-2">15.5 The Allegro Icon on the system tray will interrupt on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="380">The Break/Pause key will interrupt on Windows when the system is

for the Allegro icon (a bust of Franz Liszt, after whom the company
Franz Inc. was named), which appears in the system tray (at the lower
right) of the Windows screen. Right clicking on this icon will display
a menu which includes the command Interrupt Lisp. Choosing that
command will usually cause an error to be signaled within Lisp which
will return control to the user. Note that there is a small
possibility that the interrupt will occur at a time when an interrupt
cannot be processed and Lisp may fail.</p>

<p id="381">It is usually possible to interrupt from the Console window (where
you typically have a prompt that is responsive). The same menu over

<hr><h2 id="382"><a name="help-while-running-2">15.6 Help while running Lisp</a></h2>

<p id="383">There are a number of facilities to assist you while you are
running Lisp. Some of them are listed in this section. </p>

<p id="384">Some useful Common Lisp functions include <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/aproposa.htm"><b>apropos</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/describe.htm"><b>describe</b></a>. <b>apropos</b> takes a
case-sensitive string (or a symbol whose print name will be used as
the string) and an optional package as arguments and returns all
symbols whose names contain the string. Thus, if you can't quite
remember a function name, but are sure of part of it, call
<b>apropos</b> with the part you are sure of. We recommend using the
package argument, for without it apropos may return many symbols
internal to the system or the compiler package which clutter up the
output. </p>

<p id="385"><a href="../ansicl/dictentr/describe.htm"><b>describe</b></a> takes a Lisp
object as an argument. It is especially useful when given a
symbol. Included in the information it provides about the symbol are
whether it has a function binding (with the formal argument list if it
does), its package, whether it is internal or external in that
package, whether it is bound, and its value if it is bound. </p>

<p id="386">The function <a href="operators/excl/arglist.htm"><b>arglist</b></a>
provides the argument list of functions and macros. </p>

<p id="387">The top-level commands are listed when you enter the command
<b>:help</b> with no arguments. All top-level commands are listed,
with short descriptions. A longer description of a command is printed
when you enter :help with a command name as an argument. </p>

<p id="388">The function <a href="operators/excl/print-startup-info.htm"><b>print-startup-info</b></a> (as its name implies) is
used for printing information when Lisp starts up. However, the
information can be useful at times other than start up. The function
uses the current values of variables, compiler optimization qualities,
etc. to generate its message.  Evaluating the following form will
cause all available information to be printed:</p>

<pre id="389">
(excl:print-startup-info t nil)
</pre>




<hr><h2 id="390"><a name="initial-package-2">15.6.1 The package on startup</a></h2>

<p id="391">
By default, the initial package on startup is common-graphics-user
(nicknamed cg-user) when using the IDE and common-lisp-user (nicknamed
cl-user) when not using the IDE. The current package is displayed in
the prompt.
</p>
<p id="392">
Getting a different package on startup is not as easy as you might
thing. You cannot change packages in a file (since <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/package.htm"><code>*package*</code></a> is bound during file
loading) so you cannot use an init file (see
<a href="#init-files-1">Section 13.0 Initialization and the sys:siteinit.cl and [.]clinit.cl files</a>) and the <b>-e</b>
command-line argument is processed too early to be effective.
</p>
<p id="393">
Instead, you have to modify the <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> appropriately. How to
do it is described in <a href="delivery.htm#initial-package-2">Specifying the initial value of
*package*</a> in
<a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a>. <a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a>
discusses writing your own application (where you control the values
of the various global variables). The following code in your
.clinit.cl file (see <a href="#init-files-1">Section 13.0 Initialization and the sys:siteinit.cl and [.]clinit.cl files</a>) will
modify the <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> while preserving
whatever else it does:
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="395"><a name="files-looked-for-at-startup-1">16.0 Files that may be looked for on startup and after startup</a></h2>

<p id="396">The following two tables list files that may be looked for when
Allegro CL starts up and immediately afterwards. </p>

<p id="397">Table 1 lists the files that Lisp may need to start up at
all. Failure to find one will result in a message from the operating
system or the executable itself explaining the failure. No recovery is
possible.</p>

<p id="398">Table 2 lists other files that Lisp may need during or after
startup. Failure to find these files may cause a Lisp warning or
error. Failure to find a file in some cases causes Lisp to exit.</p>

<p id="399">We distinguish between system files, application files, and user
files. System files are supplied as part of Allegro CL, the operating
system, or other system components such as the window system;
application files are those loaded into Lisp by the application
programmer prior to the creation of the executable image; user files
are additional runtime files belonging to the current user and
referenced after the executable image is invoked.</p>

<p id="400">Certain of the files in Table 1 are looked for in the Allegro
directory location.</p>
