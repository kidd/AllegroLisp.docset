<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
widget
</i></p>

<p id="4">
Initiates a dragging operation from <i>widget</i>. The
user may "drop" onto another control by clicking the mouse to
associate the two controls together in some way.
</p>
<p id="5">
The drag continues until the user "drops" by either pressing a mouse
button (if no mouse buttons were down when <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a> was called),
releasing a mouse button (if a mouse button was down when <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a> was
called), or pressing ESCAPE to cancel the drag.
</p>
<p id="6">
During this time, the mouse cursor changes to indicate whether a drop
is allowed at the current mouse cursor location. A drop is allowed
whenever the mouse cursor is over a control where <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a> returns true when
called on the dragged control and that dropped-onto control. When the
drop is done on the dragged widget, then both <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a> and <a href="../d/droppable-onto-self.htm"><b>droppable-onto-self</b></a> must return true to
allow the drop.
</p>
<p id="7">
The default <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a> and
<a href="../d/droppable-onto-self.htm"><b>droppable-onto-self</b></a> methods
return <code>nil</code>, so an application must supply
methods in order to allow any drag-and-drop behavior.
</p>
<p id="8">
By convention, <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a> should not be called
for a particular control if
</p>
<pre id="9">
(draggable-p control) 
</pre>
<p id="10">
returns <code>nil</code>. The default <a href="../d/draggable-p.htm"><b>draggable-p</b></a> method
returns true for any control.
</p>
<p id="11">
If the user drops where a drop is allowed, then <a href="../g/good-drop.htm"><b>good-drop</b></a> is called; if the user
drops elsewhere, then <a href="../b/bad-drop.htm"><b>bad-drop</b></a> is called; if the user
cancels by pressing ESCAPE, then neither function is called.
</p>
<p id="12">
An application will typically add <a href="../d/draggable-p.htm"><b>draggable-p</b></a> methods to determine
which controls may be dragged from, <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a> methods to determine
which controls may be dropped onto which, and <a href="../g/good-drop.htm"><b>good-drop</b></a> methods to process
successful drops. <a href="../d/drag-and-drop-mouse-moved.htm"><b>drag-and-drop-mouse-moved</b></a> methods could be added
to trigger side effects as the user drags the mouse cursor.
</p>
<p id="13">
<a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a>
returns the control that was dropped onto if any, or <code>nil</code> otherwise. There is no dropped-onto control if
the user either cancels the drag by pressing ESCAPE or drops at a
location that is not over any control.
</p>
<p id="14">
By default, the only visual indication that a drag is taking place is
the changing mouse cursor. This is the standard drag-and-drop
approach in Windows. But if
</p>
<pre id="15">
(drag-images (configuration *system*))
</pre>
<p id="16">
is set to true, then an attempt is made to drag an image of some part
of the dragged-from control. (See <a href="../c/configuration.htm"><b>configuration</b></a>, <a href="../../../variables/cg/s_system_s.htm"><code>*system*</code></a>, and
<a href="../d/drag-images.htm"><b>drag-images</b></a>.)
</p>
<p id="17">
This image is obtained by calling <a href="../b/box-to-drag.htm"><b>box-to-drag</b></a> on the
dragged-from control and copying pixels from the screen for that
section of the control. <a href="../b/box-to-drag.htm"><b>box-to-drag</b></a> methods are
supplied for most of the controls to specify the area occupied by the
currently selected value of the control. Note that this approach will
not work well if the current value of the control is ever scrolled out
of view. Depending on which types of controls are being dragged from,
these images may or may not be considered sufficiently aesthetic for
an application's interface, and so this dragging option should not be
used if the result is unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p id="18">
When the IDE is running, a general <a href="../m/mouse-left-down.htm"><b>mouse-left-down</b></a> method (shown
below) causes <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a> to be called if the
ALT key is held down and a left click and drag is done on a control.
A <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a>
method for the inspector allows dropping arbitrary values from
arbitrary controls into inspector slots, and a <a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a> method specializing on
both the main IDE toolbar and the extended IDE toolbar allows dragging
commands between or within these toolbars. Other than these cases, the
IDE does not make use of <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a>, and the methods
described in this paragraph exist in the IDE only. Applications must
define their own gestures to call <a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a>, as well as their own
<a href="../d/droppable-p.htm"><b>droppable-p</b></a>
methods to define where drops are allowed.
</p>
<p id="19">
The following code implements the IDE's <a href="../m/mouse-left-down.htm"><b>mouse-left-down</b></a> method for
initiating drags. It checks to see if the alt-key is down (but not
the control-key or shift-key) and if the mouse cursor was in the
interior area of the widget that was clicked. If so, it then
initiates a drag, and otherwise it calls the next method.
</p>
<pre id="20">
(defmethod mouse-left-down ((widget dialog-item)
                            buttons cursor-position)
  ;; This method exists in the IDE to allow initiating drags
  ;; by alt-clicking any widget.
  (with-boxes (box1)
    (case (logand buttons #.(logior control-key shift-key alt-key))
      (#.alt-key
       (when (and (draggable-p widget)
                  (inside-box-p cursor-position
                                (nvisible-box (window widget) box1)))
         (drag-and-drop widget)))
      (t (call-next-method)))))
</pre>
<p id="21">
Applications can add similar methods to initiate drags. Note that
while a simple left click could alternately be used to initiate a
drag, this should not be done for certain widgets where a <a href="../m/mouse-left-down.htm"><b>mouse-left-down</b></a> always
waits for a <a href="../m/mouse-left-up.htm"><b>mouse-left-up</b></a> to complete a value
selection gesture, since the mouse will not be in a meaningful
position for this when the user finally releases the mouse button
after dragging; this constraint appears to be limited to the <a href="../../../classes/cg/single-item-list.htm"><code>single-item-list</code></a> and
<a href="../../../classes/cg/multi-item-list.htm"><code>multi-item-list</code></a> widgets. See also
<a href="../w/wait-for-drag.htm"><b>wait-for-drag</b></a> for
another way to decide whether to initiate a drag.

<h3 id="22">
GTK Note
</h3>

<p id="23">
<a href="../d/drag-and-drop.htm"><b>drag-and-drop</b></a> is not yet
supported on the GTK platform due to an unsolved problem with not
being able to change the mouse cursor while the mouse button is down.
If you call the function on GTK, it will otherwise work, but it is not
really useful without being able to change the mouse cursor image to
show the user where a drop is allowed.
