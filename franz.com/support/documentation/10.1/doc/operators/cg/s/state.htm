<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
widget
</i></p>

<h3 id="4">State for windows and miscellaneous controls</h3>
<p id="5">
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> works
differently on <a href="../../../classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a>s, as described below
under the heading <b>State on outline-items</b>.
</p>
<p id="6">
This generic function returns two values. The first is the state of
the argument, which should be a window or a visible control of some
sort. Possible values for most objects are <code>:normal</code>
and <code>:shrunk</code>. Windows can also be
<code>:icon</code>, and <code>:maximized</code>. The
second returned value is described under the heading <b>Second
returned value</b> below.
</p>

<ul>
<li id="7">
<code>:normal</code>: the control or window has its normal size
and is visible.
</li>
<li id="8">
<code>:shrunk</code>: the control or window is shrunken and not visible.
</li>
<li id="9">
<code>:icon</code>: the window is shrunk to a visible icon.
</li>
<li id="10">
<code>:maximized</code>: the window is extended to its maximum size.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="11">
The associated generic function <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> is called
whenever the state of a window is changed, either programmatically by
calling other exported functions such as <a href="../s/shrink-window.htm"><b>shrink-window</b></a>, <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a>, and <a href="../z/zoom-window.htm"><b>zoom-window</b></a>, or
interactively when the user clicks the shrink, maximize, or restore
buttons on a window frame.
</p>
<p id="12">
The <i>value</i> argument to <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> can be
passed as <code>:expanded</code> to expand the window to
<code>:normal</code> or <code>:maximized</code>, whichever
it was before being shrunk (if it has never been expanded, it is made
<code>:normal</code>). Note that <code>:expanded</code> is
not a true state, so the resulting state of the window will be either
<code>:normal</code> or <code>:maximized</code>.
</p>
<p id="13">
A <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf
state)</b></a> &nbsp;<code>:around</code> method
prevents any other non-<code>:around</code>
&nbsp;<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> methods from being called if the
state would not actually be changed by the call. Therefore any methods
added by an application do not need to handle this efficiency
consideration. This around method also coerces the special
<code>:expanded</code> state to either
<code>:normal</code> or <code>:maximized</code> and passes
that value to the other <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> methods that it calls, so any
primary, <code>:before</code>, or <code>:after</code>
&nbsp;<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> methods added by an application
will not receive the <code>:expanded</code> state.
</p>
<p id="14">
The generic functions <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> and <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> may be
called on dialog-items or windows, while the other three functions
apply only to windows.
</p>
<h3 id="15">Second returned value</h3>
<p id="16">
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> returns a
second value for the "expanded state" of the window. This value is
always either <code>:normal</code> or
<code>:maximized</code>. If the current state of the window is
<code>:shrunk</code> or <code>:icon</code>, then the value
is the state into which the window will be placed if <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a> is called on it or if
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf
state)</b></a> is called on it with the <code>:expanded</code>
state. This is also the most recent expanded state that the window was
in, or <code>:normal</code> if it has never been expanded. If
the current state of the window is <code>:normal</code> or
<code>:maximized</code>, the value is the state to which the
window was most recently expanded from <code>:shrunk</code> or
<code>:icon</code> state.
</p>
<h3 id="17">Example</h3>
<p id="18">
Here is an example of an added <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> :around
method that looks at both the old and new states of any frame-window
whose state may be changing, and reports any change. Typcially several
custom methods on <a href="../s/shrink-window.htm"><b>shrink-window</b></a>, <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a>, and so on in 5.0.1
could be collapsed into such a single <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> method.
A simpler :after method could be used instead if the old state is not
of interest.
</p>
<p id="19">
The <a href="../../excl/without-package-locks.htm"><b>without-package-locks</b></a> is
needed here in a source code file that's not in the common-graphics
package only because it specializes a common-graphics method on a
built-in common-graphics class; normally an application would
specialize on its own subclass instead.
</p>
<p id="20">
The <i>requested-state</i> argument is ignored because
it may be :expanded, and we are interested here in the resulting
:normal or :maximized state instead.  Similarly, some other <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a>
method could coerce the requested state to something else.
</p>
<p id="21">
<a href="../../ide/eval-in-listener-thread.htm"><b>eval-in-listener-thread</b></a> is
used to make sure that the printed output always goes to the selected
IDE listener pane (and so this method is suitable only for the IDE and
not for a generated application).  Otherwise, the message will go to
the *terminal-io* of whatever thread changed the window state; for
example, clicking the minimize button of an IDE window would iconize
the window in the IDE GUI thread, for which *terminal-io* is bound to
the console, and so the output would appear there.
</p>
<p id="22">
The <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/prog1pro.htm"><b>prog1</b></a> is used
to ensure that this <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> method returns whatever the next
called method returns, though that would normally be the
requested-state.
</p>
<pre id="23">
(without-package-locks
 (defmethod (setf state) :around (requested-state (window frame-window))
   (declare (ignore requested-state))
   (let* ((old-state (state window))
          new-state)
     (prog1 (call-next-method)
       (setq new-state (state window))
       (unless (eq old-state new-state)
         (ide:eval-in-listener-thread
          `(format t "~&State of ~s changed from ~s to ~s.~%"
             (name ,window) ,old-state ,new-state)))))))
</pre>

<h3 id="24">State on outline-items</h3>



<p id="25">
The <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a>
property also applies to <a href="../../../classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a>s, though the valid
values are <code>:closed</code>, <code>:open</code>, and
<code>:partially-open</code>, rather than the values listed
above.
</p>
<p id="26">
<code>:closed</code> indicates that the item's subitems are not
currently shown, while <code>:open</code> indicates that they
are.  <code>:partially-open</code> indicates that some but
perhaps not all of the subitems are currently shown, and so the next
user gesture to toggle the state will show all subitems, rather than
hiding them as is normally done when subitems are already showing.
</p>
<p id="27">
<code>:partially-open</code> is probably useful only when a
<a href="../r/range-on-open.htm"><b>range-on-open</b></a>
method has been supplied for the outline, since a <a href="../r/range-on-open.htm"><b>range-on-open</b></a> method can be written
to return different sets of subitems at different times depending on
some arbitrary current context. 
</p>
<p id="28">
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf
state)</b></a> may be called on an outline-item to hide or show its
subitems, as an alternative to calling <a href="../c/close-outline-item-value.htm"><b>close-outline-item-value</b></a> or <a href="../o/open-outline-item-value.htm"><b>open-outline-item-value</b></a>;
passing <code>:partially-open</code> will show the subitems, but
leave the outline-item in a state where the next user gesture to
toggle the state will again show subitems. The state of an
outline-item may also be established by passing the
<code>:state</code> initarg when calling <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> to create the outline-item.
</p>
<p id="29">
The <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf
state)</b></a> method for an <a href="../../../classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a> does not do certain additional
things (that were done is earlier releases) that an interactive
toggling of the item state might do, such as moving the keyboard focus
to the item and scrolling the item into view. This was especially
inefficient when programmatically setting the state of a number of
outline-items, and could leave the focus on an arbitrary item.  An
application can control the extra behavior with calls to the setf's of
functions such as <a href="../f/focus-index.htm"><b>focus-index</b></a>, <a href="../s/selected-outline-item.htm"><b>selected-outline-item</b></a>, and a call to
<a href="../s/set-first-visible-line.htm"><b>set-first-visible-line</b></a>.
