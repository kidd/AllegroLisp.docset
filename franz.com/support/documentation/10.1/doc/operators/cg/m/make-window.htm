Creates and returns a new window, or returns <code>nil</code> if the request to the Operating System to create
a new window fails (see the information under the heading
<b>make-window returns <code>nil</code> if a window cannot be created</b> near the
bottom of this page).
</p>
<p id="5">
The <i>name</i> argument should be a symbol (we
recommend using keywords) which does not name any other object. The
name can be passed as an argument to <a href="../f/find-window.htm"><b>find-window</b></a> and other find-
functions to get a programmatic handle on a window.
</p>
<p id="6">
When using the Integrated Development Environment, you can design
windows to be used in your application using forms. A <a href="../../../classes/cg/form.htm"><code>form</code></a> is a class of
window that is used to design windows of other classes. The Integrated
Development Environment creates a function from a form you have
designed which creates the designed window. Get a new form by clicking
<a href="../../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#new-form">File |
New Form</a>. You are asked for the class of the window (the
value of the :class argument) and that is the type of window that
will be designed with the form.
</p>
<p id="7">
Here are some keyword arguments to <a href="../m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="8">
<b>:class</b>: default: <a href="../../../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a>. The class of the window
being created. The standard choices besides <a href="../../../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a> are <a href="../../../classes/cg/text-edit-window.htm"><code>text-edit-window</code></a>, <a href="../../../classes/cg/bitmap-window.htm"><code>bitmap-window</code></a>, <a href="../../../classes/cg/dialog.htm"><code>dialog</code></a>, 
<a href="../../../classes/cg/rich-edit-dialog.htm"><code>rich-edit-dialog</code></a>,
and
<a href="../../../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a>. We recommend
that you subclass these standard classes so your customizations will
not affect existing windows. In earlier releases, this argument was
named <i>device</i> and that name is still accepted. Do
not, of course, specify both. 
<p id="9">
The accessor/setter of the <code>class</code> property is <a href="../d/device.htm"><b>device</b></a>, though it is
uncommon to need to use that function programmatically (one typically
sets this slot upon creation or using the <code>class</code>
slot in an inspector window). <code>(class-name (class-of
object))</code> also serves as an accessor.
</p>
</li>
<li id="10">
<b>:owner</b>: an existing window (or the screen) that will be the
owner of the new window. The default owner is the value returned by
<code>(development-main-window *system*)</code>, which is the
invisible IDE owner window when the IDE is present, and otherwise the
screen.  See <a href="../d/development-main-window.htm"><b>development-main-window</b></a>.
<p id="11">
A window shrinks or closes whenever its owner window does. If the
<i>child-p</i> argument is true, then the owner will
also be the parent of the new window. A window moves along with its
parent, and is clipped at the interior edge of the parent. In earlier
releases, this argument was named <i>parent</i> and that
name is still accepted. Do not, of course, specify both.
</p>
<p id="12">
See <a href="../../../cgide.htm#child-parent-overlapped-etc-1">About child, parent, and owner
windows</a> in <a href="../../../cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="13">
<b>:child-p</b>: default is <code>t</code>. A boolean
value indicating whether the new window will be a child window. If
non-nil and the owner is a window rather than the screen, then the new
window will be a child window and the owner window will also be its
parent. A child window moves along with its parent and is clipped at
the parent's interior border. If <code>nil</code> or the
owner is the screen, then the new window will float freely about on
the screen, but will still shrink and close along with its owner (if
the owner is a window). The parent of a non-child window is the
screen.
<p id="14">
<b>GTK note</b>: On X platforms, we strongly discourage specifying
<i>child-p</i> as <code>nil</code>, because
non-child owned windows are often not handled well.  A typical window
manager will add a separate taskbar item (and alt-tab item) for each
non-child window, and will allow the user to move other applications
between an owned window and its owner window in the occlusion stack.
Common Graphics may also not be allowed to move the keyboard focus to
a different top-level window programmatically.
</p>

</li>
<li id="15">

<b>:dialog-items (formerly :widgets)</b>: default: <code>nil</code>. The value should be a list of controls (also
called widgets, whence the former argument name) to be placed on the
window. While controls can be placed on any window, only windows of
type <a href="../../../classes/cg/dialog-mixin.htm"><code>dialog-mixin</code></a> (that is, only windows
whose class is a subclass of <a href="../../../classes/cg/dialog-mixin.htm"><code>dialog-mixin</code></a>) will have the special
Windows dialog behavior. In such windows, pressing the TAB key moves
the keyboard focus from one control to another and pressing
Alt-[letter] will move the keyboard focus to the control that
has the letter underlined as its access character. (For example,
pressing Alt-A will move keyboard focus to the control whose access
letter is an underlined A.)
<p id="16">
Each widget in the list is created by calling <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> on a subclass of <a href="../../../classes/cg/dialog-item.htm"><code>dialog-item</code></a>. See
the list of all <a href="../../../cgide.htm#widget-classes-1">widget
classes</a> in <a href="../../../cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>. Each widget
instance can be used on only a single parent window.
</p>
<p id="17">
The use of :widgets to name this argument is deprecated. :dialog-items
should be used instead. :widgets is accepted and both should not be
specified.
</p>
</li>
<li id="18">
<b>:pop-up</b>: default: <code>nil</code>. See <a href="../p/pop-up.htm"><b>pop-up</b></a>. This argument should be
specified true if the window is intended to be
modal. Note that the value of this property
cannot be changed once the window has been created.
<p id="19">
See <a href="../../../cgide.htm#child-parent-overlapped-etc-1">About child, parent, and owner windows</a> in <a href="../../../cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="20">
<b>:form-p</b>: this parameter is for internal use by the IDE, and should
not be specified by applications.
</li>
<li id="21">
<b>:child-name</b>: when instantiating a window class that has the
<a href="../../../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a> mixin (such
as <a href="../../../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a> or <a href="../../../classes/cg/bitmap-window.htm"><code>bitmap-window</code></a>), the
:child-name argument may be passed to make-window to provide a name
for the child pane that is created automatically for the frame
window. As with other object names that are used in Allegro CL for
finding objects, the name should be a symbol.
<p id="22">
In fact it is unlikely that this name will be needed programmatically,
since the child-pane can be found by calling <a href="../f/frame-child.htm"><b>frame-child</b></a> on the parent frame
window, it is nevertheless often helpful for arbitrary objects to have
names so that the they can be recognized more easily during debugging.
</p>
</li>
<li id="23">
<b>:behind</b>: this argument determines whether the new window should
be placed behind or in front of its siblings in the occlusion
stack. The default is <code>nil</code>, which places the
window in front or its siblings. A value of <code>t</code>
places the window behind all of its siblings. If the value is another
window that is already on the owner window, the new window is placed
immediately behind the specified window.
</li>
<li id="24">
<b>:state</b>: the initial state of the newly created window. Possible
states are :normal (window has its normal size and is visible, this is
the default); :shrunk (window is shrunken and not visible); :icon
(window is shrunk to a visible icon); and :maximized (window is
extended to its maximum size).
<p id="25">
When creating a window, the window is placed into its initial visible
state (as specified by the :state initarg) by a <a href="../../excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> :around method. This
means that if an application adds device-open methods (including
:after methods) for its window subclasses, for example to set up child
windows on the window, the main window will be shown only after this
setup is complete, to avoid distracting the user and to increase
creation speed. (An alternate approach is simply to create the main
window in :shrunk state, then do arbitrary setup, and then set the
state of the main window to :normal.)
</p>
</li>
<li id="26">
<b>:exterior</b>: a box (see <a href="../m/make-box.htm"><b>make-box</b></a>) in the coordinates of the
parent that determines the initial position and size of the exterior
boundary of the window.  Note that if the new window is a non-child
window, then the box should always be in screen coordinates, even if
the window has an owner window.
<p id="27">
<b>GTK Note</b>: For a top-level window on the GTK platforms (Linux
and Mac), you probably should always pass
the <i>interior</i> argument rather than this argument
or any of the others that apply to the exterior. The reason is that
X11 makes it difficult or impossible (depending on the particular X
server) to control the placement of the window manager frame of a
top-level window, or even to determine its thickness. To make a
cross-platform application work the same on Windows,
the <i>interior</i> argument can be used universally.
Child windows do not have this problem.
</p>
</li>
<li id="28">
<b>:interior</b>: an alternative to :exterior, in that the box
specifies the boundary of the client (interior) area of the window,
again in the coordinates of the parent.  The frame of the window will
protrude outward from this box as needed.
</li>
<li id="29">
<b>:exterior-top-left</b>: another alternative for the initial
position.  A position in the coordinates of the parent that determines
the initial position of the top-left corner of the window.  Another
alternative is to pass individual coordinates using the :left and or
:top arguments.  If the window position is not determined by any
make-window arguments or the default-initargs of the window class,
then the initial position is determined by the <a href="../d/default-top-left.htm"><b>default-top-left</b></a> generic function.
</li>
<li id="30">
<b>:width</b> and <b>:height</b>: another alternative for the initial
size. Integers specifying the exterior width and/or height of the
window in pixels. If the width and/or height are not determined by any
make-window arguments or default-initargs of the window class, then
the initial size is determined by the <a href="../d/default-width.htm"><b>default-width</b></a> and/or <a href="../d/default-height.htm"><b>default-height</b></a> generic
functions.
</li>
<li id="31">
<b>:centered</b>: specifies whether to initially center the window
over the interior of its parent or owner.  If <code>nil</code> (the default), then no centering is done.  If
<code>:on-parent</code>, then the window will be centered over
its <a href="../p/parent.htm"><b>parent</b></a>.  For
any other true value, the window will be centered over its <a href="../o/owner.htm"><b>owner</b></a>.  If an
<i>exterior</i> or <i>interior</i>
argument is passed along with a true <i>centered</i>
argument, then the exterior or interior box will determine the size of
the window while the centering will determine its position.  A true
<i>centered</i> argument would override an
<i>exterior-top-left</i> argument.  See also <a href="../c/center-window.htm"><b>center-window</b></a> and the
<a href="../c/centered.htm"><b>centered</b></a>
property.
</li>
<li id="32">
<b>:double-buffered</b>: specifies whether the window uses a memory
bitmap to reduce flashing when redrawing the window (not needed on
GTK). This option is <code>nil</code> by default for
backward compatibility and because it uses memory resources, but it is
generally recommended to pass this initarg as true for any window on
which an application draws. See <a href="../d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a>.
</li>
</ul>


<p id="33">
There are many other options (specified by initarg (a keyword)/value
pairs) to <a href="../m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>. In general, the
initargs are keywords with the same name as properties,
:left-attachment for left-attachment, e.g.)
</p>

<h3 id="34">make-window returns nil if a window cannot be created</h3>

<p id="35">
<a href="../m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>
returns <code>nil</code> if the operating system fails to
make the requested window. Such failure is typically due to one of the
operating system's tables for all windows and menus becoming full.
This situation should be rare, but if it does happen, your application
should be modified to close any windows or menus that are no longer
being used, in order to free up the corresponding operating system
resources. Windows may be closed programmatically by calling <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/close.htm"><b>close</b></a> on them.
