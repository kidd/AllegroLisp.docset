<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
window
</i></p>

<p id="4">
Expands <i>window</i> (if it is shrunken) to fill its
previous box. Does nothing if <i>window</i> is already
expanded.  
</p>
<p id="5">
The return value of this function is undefined and no meaning should
be attributed to the value actually returned. Information about the
success or failure of the expansion is not available.
</p>
<p id="6">
When <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a> is called on a window
whose <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> is
:shrunk or :icon, the window is returned to either :normal or
:maximized state, depending on which of these two states the window
most recently had. If it has not yet had either of these states, then
it is put into :normal state. For iconized windows, this emulates
clicking on the restore button of the icon.
</p>
<p id="7">
This operator is
now a non-generic function. It calls <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a>, which is
a generic function to effect the change in its argument's
state. Methods can be added to <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> to affect
the behavior of this function, as is done in the example below.
</p>
<h3 id="8">Example of a method on (setf state) affecting window expansion</h3>
<p id="9">
When <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a> is called on a window
whose state is :shrunk or :icon, the window is returned to either
:normal or :maximized state, depending on which of these two states
the window most recently had. If it has not yet had either of these
states, then it is put into :normal state. For iconized windows, this
emulates clicking on the restore button of the icon. Alternately, the
<i>new-state</i> argument to <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> can be
passed as :expanded to achieve the same result; expand-window itself
calls (setf state) in this way. (:expanded is not a true state, so the
resulting state of the window will be either :normal or :maximized.)
</p>
<p id="10">
A <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf
state)</b></a> :around method prevents any other non-:around (setf
state) methods from being called if the state would not actually be
changed by the call. Therefore any methods added by an application do
not need to handle this efficiency consideration. This around method
also coerces the special :expanded state to either :normal or
:maximized and passes that value to the other 
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> methods
that it calls, so any primary, :before, or :after 
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> methods
added by an application will not receive the :expanded state.
</p>

<p id="11">
The generic function <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> returns a new second value
for the "expanded state" of the window. This value is always either
:normal or :maximized. If the current state of the window is :shrunk
or :icon, then the value is the state into which the window will be
placed if expand-window is called on it or if 
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> is called
on it with the :expanded state. This is also the most recent expanded
state that the window was in, or :normal if it has never been
expanded. If the current state of the window is :normal or
:maximized, the value is the state to which the window was most
recently expanded from :shrunk or :icon state.
</p>
<p id="12">
Here is an example of an added <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> :around
method that looks at both the old and new states of any frame-window
whose state may be changing, and reports any change. Typically several
custom methods on <a href="../s/shrink-window.htm"><b>shrink-window</b></a>, <a href="../e/expand-window.htm"><b>expand-window</b></a>, and so on
could be collapsed into such a single <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> method.
A simpler :after method could be used instead if the old state is not
of interest.
</p>
<p id="13">
The <a href="../../excl/without-package-locks.htm"><b>without-package-locks</b></a> is
needed here in a source code file that's not in the
<code>cg</code> package only because it specializes a Common
Graphics method on a built-in Common Graphics class; normally an
application would specialize on its own subclass instead.
</p>
<p id="14">
The requested-state argument is ignored because it may be :expanded,
and we are interested here in the resulting :normal or :maximized
state instead.  Similarly, some other <a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a> method
could coerce the requested state to something else.
</p>
<p id="15">
<a href="../../ide/eval-in-listener-thread.htm"><b>eval-in-listener-thread</b></a> is used to
make sure that the printed output always goes to the selected IDE
listener pane (and so this method is suitable only for the IDE and not
for a generated application).  Otherwise, the message will go to the
<a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/terminal.htm"><code>*terminal-io*</code></a> of whatever
thread changed the window state; for example, clicking the minimize
button of an IDE window would iconize the window in the IDE GUI
thread, for which <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/terminal.htm"><code>*terminal-io*</code></a> is bound to the console, and so
the output would appear there.
</p>
<p id="16">
The prog1 is used to ensure that this 
<a href="../s/state.htm"><b>(setf state)</b></a>
method returns
whatever the next called method returns, though that would normally be
the requested-state.
