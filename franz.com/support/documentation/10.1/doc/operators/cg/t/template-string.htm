<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
editable-text
</i></p>

<p id="4">
Returns the template for a single-line <a href="../../../classes/cg/editable-text.htm"><code>editable-text</code></a> control, which
constrains the number and type of characters that a user can type into
the control. 
The value can be set at creation time by specifying the
<i>template-string</i> initarg, or any time later by
calling <a href="../t/template-string.htm"><b>(setf
template-string)</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="5">
A template consists of two kinds of characters: 
</p>
<ol>
<li id="6">

static characters that are shown in the control and over which users
cannot type (the cursor is moved past these characters as the user
types or uses the arrow keys).

</li>
<li id="7">

template characters, which must be described in the <a href="../../../variables/cg/s_template-chars_s.htm"><code>*template-chars*</code></a>
association list (any character not in this alist is regarded as a
static character). Initially the template characters appear as
blank spaces, zeroes, or other default characters in the
control and allow users to enter certain types of characters depending
on which template character is specified for each position.

</li>
</ol>
<p id="8">
Templates can be cleared with <a href="../c/clear-template.htm"><b>clear-template</b></a>.
</p>
<h3 id="9">
Example:
</h3>
<pre id="10">
(setf (template-string my-editable-text-widget) "999-99-9999")
</pre>
<p id="11">
This example would set up a template for entering a social security
number. There is an entry in 
<a href="../../../variables/cg/s_template-chars_s.htm"><code>*template-chars*</code></a> for
the character #\9 indicating that a user must enter a numeral in its
position, and that it displays initially as a space. There is no entry
in <a href="../../../variables/cg/s_template-chars_s.htm"><code>*template-chars*</code></a> for the dash
character, so the dashes in this template will display as dashes, and
users cannot type over them.
</p>
<p id="12">
<a href="../t/template-string.htm"><b>template-string</b></a>
is a property of the <a href="../../../classes/cg/editable-text.htm"><code>editable-text</code></a> class, as well as the
<a href="../../../classes/cg/editable-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>editable-text-column-mixin</code></a>
and <a href="../../../classes/cg/combo-box-column-mixin.htm"><code>combo-box-column-mixin</code></a>&nbsp; <a href="../../../classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> classes.

<h2 id="13">
Behavior of Various Keystrokes
</h2>

<p id="14">
When a graphical character is typed, it will be considered for the
character position at the text cursor if there is a template character
rather than a static character at that position.  Otherwise it will be
considered for the first position to the right of that position at
which there is a template character, if any.  If the typed character
passes the predicate function for that position, then it will replace
the character at that position.  The text cursor will then move to the
next template character position to the right, if there is one, and
otherwise will move to the rightmost end of the template string.  When
the character is not valid at the current position, there is a beep
and nothing else is done.
</p>
<p id="15">
A special case is that if the text cursor is at the rightmost end of
the template string, then typing a character will shift each character
that has already been typed one template character position to the
left, and then the new character is written to the rightmost template
character position.  This is typically used for entering numbers as
with a calculator or ATM machine.
</p>
<p id="16">
If any text is selected when a graphical character is typed, then the
selected characters are first converted (cleared) to the initial print
characters for those positions, then the text cursor is moved to the
front of the selection (deselecting the text), and then the character
is handled as above.  An exception is that if the <a href="../j/justification.htm"><b>justification</b></a> of the widget is
<code>:right</code> and all of the text is selected, then the
text cursor is moved to the end of the selection rather than to the
front.
</p>
<p id="17">
The left and right arrow keys will move the text cursor to the next
template character position in each direction if there is one, or else
to front or end of the template string if it is not there already.
Pressing the left and right arrow keys while holding down the Shift
key will select text as usual.
</p>
<p id="18">
The <b>Home</b> key will move the text cursor to the first template
character position that does not have a space in it, unless the text
cursor is already in that posiiton, in which case it will move to the
first template character position.  (In other words, typing
<b>Home</b> will first move to the beginning of the text that has been
entered, and typing it again will move to the first typable position.
That is intended to be useful especially when editing right-justified
numbers.)  Similarly, typing <b>End</b> will first move the text
cursor just to the right of the last template character position that
does not contain a space, unless the text cursor is already at that
position, in which case it is moved just after the last template
character position.
</p>
<p id="19">
The <b>Delete</b> key will change the character at the text cursor to
the initial print character for that position and move to the next
template character position to the right.  The <b>Backspace</b> key
will move to the next template character position to the left and
change the character at that position to the initial print character
for that position.  A special case is that typing <b>Delete</b> when
the text cursor is at the rightmost end of the template string will
delete the last character by shifting all other typed characters one
position to the right.
</p>

<h2 id="20">
Allowing Numeric Sign Characters
</h2>

<p id="21">
If the <a href="../t/template-allows-sign.htm"><b>template-allows-sign</b></a>
property of the widget is true, then the user will be allowed to type
a plus or minus character in any template character position that is
to the left of all non-space typed characters.
