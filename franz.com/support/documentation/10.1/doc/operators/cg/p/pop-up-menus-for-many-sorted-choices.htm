<p id="5">
This function takes a list of pre-sorted
<b><i>choices</i></b> and presents them to the user as a
series of pop-up menus (by calling <a href="../p/pop-up-menu.htm"><b>pop-up-menu</b></a> one or more times). The main purpose
of this function is to make it easy to select one of many choices.
</p>
<p id="6">
This function is challenging to describe. We will start with a simple
example where we do not use the keyword arguments, then we will
describe the arguments in more detail, then we have a more complex
example.
</p>
<p id="7">
<b><i>choices</i></b> must be list of objects arranged
so their printnames (as created by the function which is the value of
the <i>on-print</i> argument) are in alphanumeric
order. Just to use strings (assuming default
<i>on-print</i>), <code>("Jones" "Smith" "Smits"
"Watson" "Williams" "Wilson")</code> is a suitable
value. <code>("Smith" "Smits" "Watson" "Williams" "Jones"
"Wilson")</code> is not. (The menu presenting algorithm may get
confused if the printnames are out of order.) So this call:
</p>

<pre id="8">
(pop-up-menus-for-many-sorted-choices '("Jones" "Smith" "Smits"
                                        "Watson" "Williams" "Wilson"))
</pre>

<p id="9">
causes this menu to be displayed:
</p>

<p id="10"><img src="../../../pictures/pumfmsc-1.jpg"></p>

<p id="11">
Note that, for reasons having to do with how multiprocessing in the
IDE is done, clicks away from the menu and keystrokes are not seen by
the menu, so this example menu cannot be dismissed -- you must follow
it through to a choice. In the example below, things are set up so the
menu can be dismissed and keystrokes can be used to choose items. Here
we are only interested in showing what the choices are in the cascade
of menus displayed.
</p>
<p id="12">
In our choices, we have three initial characters, <b>J</b>, <b>S</b>,
and <b>W</b>, so there are three choices in the initial menu. Each new
menu will have as many choices as there are different characters in
the position of the remaining choices at the position where they start
to differ. 
</p>
<p id="13">
The choices are <b>Jones</b>, <b>Smit...</b>, and
<b>W...</b>. <b>Jones</b> has no ellipsis (...) because there
is only one choice beginning with <b>J</b> so if you select it, you
get it. the other two have ellipses because there are
multiple choices. The ellipsis starts where the characters
diverge (after <b>Smit</b> or after <b>W</b>). We select <b>W...</b>
and this new menu is displayed:
</p>

<p id="14"><img src="../../../pictures/pumfmsc-2.jpg"></p>

<p id="15">
Now the choices are <b>Watson</b> and <b>Wil...</b>. If you choose
<b>Watson</b>, that object is returned. If you choose <b>Wil...</b>,
you get a final menu with choices <b>Williams</b> and <b>Wilson</b>
(not illustrated). 
</p>

<p id="16">
So, a pop-up menu will be shown for each character position for which
there remain multiple choices that have different characters at that
position.  When there is a single remaining choice for a character at
the current character position, then that choice will appear on the
menu and the user may select it directly.  When there are multiple
remaining choices for a particular next character, then the menu-item
for that character will show just the character followed by an
ellipsis, and selecting that menu-item will show a further pop-up menu
for the remaining choices that have the selected character at that
position.
</p>
<p id="17">
The keyboard shortcut on each menu will be the unique character at the
current character position that either selects a final choice or
presents a further menu for that character.  This means that a choice
can be made quickly by typing the characters of the desired choice
wherever there is an ambiguity, until the choice has been fully
disambiguated.  Note that using the keyboard shortcuts requires a
proper <i>stream</i> argument, as detailed below (In our
simple example above, no <i>stream</i> argument
specified so shortcuts did not work.)
</p>
<p id="18">
<b><i>choices</i></b> is a list of arbitrary values from
which the user may select a choice.  The choices must already be
sorted alphanumerically by the strings that are returned by the
<i>on-print</i> function; otherwise the menu may be
confused.  One of the elements of this list is returned if the user
makes a selection, or <code>nil</code> is returned
immediately if the user cancels from any menu.
</p>
<p id="19">
<b><i>on-print</i></b> is a function that returns
strings that will appear in the menu. It should take a single
argument, which is one of the elements of the
<i>choices</i> list, and should return a string to
represent it.  The default value is <a href="../../../../ansicl/dictentr/write-to.htm"><b>princ-to-string</b></a>.  This function will be called
many times when there are many choices, and so it is most efficient if
it returns an existing string rather than consing a new one on each
call.  This argument could be identity if the choices are already
strings.
</p>
<p id="20">
<b><i>stream</i></b> is either the screen or else a
window that will serve as the owner of the pop-up menus.  On the
Windows platform (and perhaps elsewhere in the future), the keyboard
shortcuts for the menu items will work only if this argument is a
window that was created in the process that is calling <a href="../p/pop-up-menus-for-many-sorted-choices.htm"><b>pop-up-menus-for-many-sorted-choices</b></a>.
The default is the screen, and so the keyboard shortcuts would never
work unless this argument is passed.
</p>


<p id="21">
<b><i>position</i></b> is the position relative to the
upper-left interior corner of the window (or screen) at which the
upper-left corner of the pop-up menus will appear. The default is the
current position of the mouse cursor.x Successive menus will always
appear at the same position as the first one, rather than defaulting
again to the new mouse cursor position.
</p>


<p id="22">
<b><i>case-insensitive</i></b> should be a boolean value
that indicates whether the choices (after
the <i>on-print</i> function has converted them to the
strings to be presented) are sorted in a case-insensitve way. The
choices will then be separated into multiple menus accordingly. The
default is <code>nil</code>, meaning a case-sensitive
order.
</p>
<p id="23">
<b><i>on-help</i></b>, if specified, should be a
funcallable object (a function object or function name)
or <code>nil</code>.  The default
is <code>nil</code>.  A function may be used for
displaying status bar messages as the user highlights individual menu
items.  The function should take a single argument, which will be one
of the values in the choices list, and it should return a string that
can be displayed in a status bar.  The strings will be displayed in
the status bar of the specified stream, if it has a status bar, or
else in the status bar of the first ancestor window of that stream
that has a status bar, if any.
</p>

<h2 id="24">
An Example
</h2>

<p id="25">
Below is a complete example that uses an owner window so that keyboard
shortcuts will work.  The user's most recent choice is displayed in
the window.  Methods are defined on a window subclass so that the
initial menu may be shown either by right-clicking the window or by
pressing the spacebar when the window is selected.  The mouse or
keyboard may then be used to select choices.
</p>
<p id="26">
The short list of choices is (:apple :blueberry :cherry :chocolate
:cranberry).  There is only one choice that begins with "a", so
"apple" appears on the initial menu and may be chosen immediately.
Likewise with "blueberry" for "b".  But there are multiple choices
beginning with "c", and so the third menu item will show "c ...", and
choosing that item will show a second menu of all choices that being
with "c".  If "c" is chosen, then the second menu will show "ch ..."
for the two remaining choices that begin with "ch", followed by
"cranberry" since it is the only remaining choice that begins with
"cr".
</p>
<p id="27">
When using the keyboard to select choices most quickly, :apple could
be selected by pressing the spacebar to show the first menu, and then
pressing the "a" key.  :cranberry can be selected by typing space, c,
r, while :chocolate requires space, c, h, o.
