The Allegro CL streams model uses simple-streams, which formally have
no element-type but act in general as if they have element type
<code>(unsigned-byte 8)</code>. The implementation is described
in this document.  An older stream implementation called <i>Gray
streams</i> is still supported. It is described in
<a href="gray-streams.htm">gray-streams.htm</a>
</p><p id="5">
A simple-stream is created whenever a file is opened
(with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a>) without an
element-type specified. If <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> is called with
an <i>element-type</i> specified, a Gray stream is
created, except for string output streams, as noted next.
</p><p id="6">
String output streams are always simple-streams even though both
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-st0.htm"><b>make-string-output-stream</b></a> and
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/with-out.htm"><b>with-output-to-string</b></a> accept
an <i>element-type</i> keyword argument. Both operators
create simple-streams regardless of whether a value is specified for
the <i>element-type</i> keyword argument or not.
</p><p id="7">
The transition from Gray streams to simple-streams should be easy and
transparent unless you have done extensive stream customization.

It is unlikely that users who are not concerned with stream details
will have to concern themselves with this document. Common stream
usages, such as opening files for reading and writing, will simply
work as expected.

The standard Allegro CL stream implementation uses
<em>simple-stream</em>s. Also supported are Gray streams (see
<a href="gray-streams.htm">gray-streams.htm</a>.  Both kinds of stream may
co-exist in a lisp, and compatibility is maintained for the standard
Common Lisp streams interface, the Gray streams implementation
maintains its compatibility with previous Gray versions with minimal
source intervention when they have been used.
</p>

<p id="12">
The Allegro CL simple-stream is the next generation evolving from the
stream of the same name in Common Graphics (the windowing systems used
by Allegro CL on Windows). The Common Graphics simple-stream was
created as a basis for window-based input and output.  The new
generation of simple-stream is designed to include this window-based
I/O and at the same time to retain the speed always expected for
non-window based streams. It is also designed to promote further
advances in technology requirements such as International Character
sets and server-based I/O.

We felt a new stream implementation was needed because of problems we
found with the Gray stream design. In this section, we describe these
problems and describe the new implementation.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="15"><a name="gray-stream-problems-2">2.1 Problems with Gray streams</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li id="16">Gray streams distinguish input and output directions per class, 
    forcing combination and
    mixins in order to model the 3 different modes (input only, 
    output only, and input/output)
    for various stream classes. </li>
  <li id="17">Gray streams, in accordance with CL, distinguish streams by 
    element-type. We have found
    this to be an unfortunate limitation, since it makes it 
    hard to transfer varying-width
    elements in the same stream. Allegro CL 5.0.1 introduced 
    bivalent streams, which allow
    both varying-width elements and character elements to be transferred. 
    This was a step in
    the right direction, and enables web servers to be written more 
    easily and efficiently. </li>
  <li id="18">Gray streams methods, which define the specific streams 
    implementation, are defined
    immediately below the level of the CL streams interface, 
    which causes a couple of
    problems: <ol>
      <li id="19">The CLOS dispatch is performed at a higher 
        level than is necessary, thus creating
        inefficient instruction execution paths that are not 
        easily optimizable.</li>
      <li id="20">The implementation interface of Gray streams, which 
        is specified using CLOS, overlaps in
        its behavior, thus causing confusion as to what 
        specializations are needed. For example,
        the obvious implementation for 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char-no-hang.htm"><b>stream-read-char-no-hang</b></a> 
        is to call 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char.htm"><b>stream-read-char</b></a>
        after a call to 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-listen.htm"><b>stream-listen</b></a>. 
        However, since subclassing a stream can
        result in a version which does not perform this 
        listen/read combination, further
        subclassing is not possible without having the 
        source to this version, since it is
        otherwise not possible to know whether to define a method for 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char-no-hang.htm"><b>stream-read-char-no-hang</b></a>,
        or for 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char.htm"><b>stream-read-char</b></a> and 
        <a href="operators/excl/stream-listen.htm"><b>stream-listen</b></a>, or perhaps
        for all three, in which case it would be unknown which 
        code would be actually executed. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="21">Gray streams force the duplication of a large amount of code, 
      for the implementation of
    the basic functionalities such as 
    <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char.htm"><b>stream-read-char</b></a>. In a sense, 
    this is
    due to the fact that the implementation level is too high, and 
    this forces the duplication
    of effort in the implementation. </li>
</ol>



<hr><h2 id="22"><a name="new-hierarchy-2">2.2 A new stream hierarchy</a></h2>

<p id="23">
A new class hierarchy of streams with a base-class of 
<a href="classes/excl/simple-stream.htm"><code>simple-stream</code></a> 
removes the problems inherent
in Gray streams. Simple-streams are more efficient, and are simpler in
concept, making it easier to extend the streams interface by
object-oriented means. 
</p>

<p id="24">
A major simplification in the simple-stream hierarchy over Gray
streams is the collapsing of many class distinctions into one:
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="25">Gray streams distinguish input and output directions per class, 
    whereas simple-streams
    make this distinction with flags. </li>
  <li id="26">Gray streams distinguish streams by element-type. 
    Simple-streams have no element-type,
    but (with the exception of string streams) always act as if 
    transferring octets (8-bit bytes). </li>
</ul>

<p id="27">
The Gray streams class hierarchy distinguishes between different kinds
of stream usage. The simple-stream hierarchy distinguishes between
different kinds of external I/O device or pseudo-device. 
</p>

<p id="28">
This device-level interface is CLOS oriented, but is at a much lower
level than the Gray streams implementation level, making it much more
efficient in both execution speed and in space. 
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="29"><a name="model-1">3.0 The programming model</a></h2>

<hr><h2 id="30"><a name="getting-a-ss-2">3.1 How to get a simple-stream and how to get a Gray stream</a></h2>

<p id="31">
The Gray streams implementation is supported along with simple
streams. Programs using customized Gray streams will, therefore,
continue to work as in earlier releases with only minor
changes. (Users of Gray streams must ensure, as described below, that
calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> have the
element-type keyword argument specified -- if it is unspecified, give
it the value <code>character</code>. Users must also be careful
not to assume a stream they did not create is a Gray stream, and that
can be done using synonym streams or by loading a compatibility
package, again as described below in this section. Gray streams are
described in <a href="gray-streams.htm">gray-streams.htm</a>.)
</p>

<p id="32">
The normal mechanism used to specify a simple-stream is to call
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> (and thus any callers of
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a>, such as 
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/with-op0.htm"><b>with-open-file</b></a>)
to open the stream without specifying the element-type. This will
cause a simple-stream to be created, instead of a Gray stream. A Gray
stream will be created if an element-type argument of any kind is
given to the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> call. 
</p>

<p id="33">
A potential problem arises when legacy code requiring Gray streams
calls <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> with no
<em>element-type</em> argument. Under CL specification this kind of
open causes the element-type to default to
<code>character</code>. All CL functionality will be compatible
between Gray streams and simple-streams, but if the user was counting
on specific Gray stream functionality in character streams, then the
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> call must be changed to
include <code>:element-type 'character</code> as arguments,
which will force a Gray stream.
</p>

<p id="34">
Another problem arises when Gray streams application code assumes that
the stream it is handed is a Gray stream, and thus tries to call
<strong><em>stream-</em></strong> methods on it. (Allegro CL names the
Gray streams CLOS substrate
<strong>stream-<em>[cl-function-name]</em></strong>,
e.g. <strong>stream-read-char</strong> for
<strong>read-char</strong>.) Allegro CL with the new stream
implementation solves this problem by defining its synonym-stream
implementation as a Gray stream, but in such a way that all calls via
the synonym-stream-symbol are non-Gray-specific. For example, a call
to <strong>stream-read-char</strong> to a synonym-stream will result
in a call to <strong>read-char</strong> on the
synonym-stream-symbol. This is slightly slower than dispatching on
<strong>stream-read-char</strong>, but it does provide for
compatibility with legacy code. A programmer who doesn't want to
rewrite a subsystem to use simple-streams can simply ensure that any
stream passed to that subsystem is a synonym stream. 
</p>

<p id="35">
If the stream being manipulated is one that is not easily wrapped as a
synonym-stream, (e.g. *terminal-io*) a second approach is provided in
the form of the module <code>:gray-compat</code>. This module
contains methods on simple-streams for generic functions normally
associated with Gray streams. If, for example, the call
</p>

<pre id="36">
(stream-read-char *standard-input*) 
</pre>

<p id="37">
exists in legacy code, then requiring the
<code>:gray-compat</code> module (by evaluating
<code>(require :gray-compat)</code>) defines a method on
<strong>stream-read-char</strong> for simple-streams, which simply
wraps some argument and return-value processing around a call to
<strong>read-char</strong>. This again is slower than calling
<strong>read-char</strong> directly, but provides compatibility for
legacy code.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="38"><a name="trivial-dispatch-2">3.2 Trivial Stream Dispatch</a></h2>

<p id="39">
CL stream-functions <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-byt.htm"><b>read-byte</b></a>,
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-by.htm"><b>write-byte</b></a>, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a>, etc.,
all distinguish in a trivial manner whether the stream is a Gray or
simple stream.  If a Gray stream is detected, the associated Gray
generic function is called for the stream, so that for example,
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> calls <a href="operators/excl/stream-read-char.htm"><b>stream-read-char</b></a>,
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-ch.htm"><b>write-char</b></a> calls
<a href="operators/excl/stream-write-char.htm"><b>stream-write-char</b></a>, etc. However, if the stream is
determined to be a simple-stream, then the specified lower level
functionality for the function is called, which may involve calls to
specific device-level functionality. This is described in section 
<a href="#cl-funs-2">Section 5.1 Implementation of Common Lisp Functions for simple-streams</a> below. 
</p>

<p id="40">
Note that this trivial dispatch does not use any CLOS dispatch
mechanism, and the functionality that is called for a simple-stream
may be inlined in the function. Thus, for example, all
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-by.htm"><b>write-byte</b></a> operations for a simple-stream are
performed without any function calls, unless the buffer fills up and
<a href="operators/excl/device-write.htm"><b>device-write</b></a> must be called.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="41"><a name="ss-description-2">3.3 Simple-stream Description</a></h2>

<p id="42">
A simple-stream has no specific element-type associated with
it. Instead, the fundamental unit of transfer for a simple stream that
is not a string stream is the octet (an 8-bit byte), and all transfers
are made at the lowest level with respect to octets. It is up to the
implementation to decide how to optimize data transfers for particular
situations where data paths are either wider or narrower than 8
bits. 
</p>

<p id="43">
A simple-stream is always buffered. Whereas support is provided for
buffering for CL and Gray streams, buffering is not explicitly
required in these stream specifications.  However, the explicit
requirement that simple-streams are buffered allow a simpler and
potentially more efficient model. Note that there is no direct
interface to simple-stream buffers. The buffering layer resides just
below the CL interface level, and the device layer is just below the
buffering layer.
</p>
<p id="44">
In the following diagram, we show the function call hierarchy (top to
bottom, as higher level units have function calls to lower level
units, eventually reaching the lowest layer, which is the device
layer) and the data flow (output from Lisp left to right, input to
Lisp right to left).

There is also a set of functions provided which aid in the
implementation of the device layer, and which at the same time are
themselves User Level functions. These functions allow the design of
encapsulating streams, where the encapsulating stream's device level
becomes the encapsulated stream's user level. These functions are
discussed in <a href="#device-helpers-2">Section 10.4 Implementation Helpers for device-read and device-write</a>.
</p>

<p id="52">
The intended interaction by the user or applications programmer is to
work above the buffer level. The user does so by calling standard CL
functions. The device-level programmer may define new classes and
device-level methods for "drivers" (we are using the word
analogously to device drivers that are implemented in operating
systems), but even then it is not intended that the user call the
device-level methods directly. But note that it is possible to call
device-level methods if all of the rules are followed.  The
strategy-level programmer may design an alternate API that calls the
device-level, but it must conform to the requirements that allow the
device-level to work properly. The intended role of the API is that it
is a thin layer which manipulates its buffer and thus deals with the
device layer as little as possible. Such API's are intended to be very
fast.

<p id="54">
The device level is called that because it provides an underlying
implementation that can be specialized to suit particular kinds of
stream connections, in a similar manner to a device driver in an
operating system. 
</p>

<p id="55">
Only simple-streams provide a device layer; Gray streams do not. The
device layer puts the object implementation of a simple-stream at a
lower level than the object layer of Gray streams. 
</p>

<p id="56">The goals of the device layer are: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="57">to be used with buffering at higher levels </li>
  <li id="58">to provide a small functional interface that has no overlap </li>
  <li id="59">to use methods that are called as few times as possible (a call to the device interface
    should be thought of as a call to the operating-system, and thus expensive, so the number
    of such calls must be minimized). </li>
  <li id="60">to use fast method dispatch like the current Allegro CL 
     Gray streams implementation. </li>
  <li id="61">to allow encapsulating streams by allowing streams to implement 
     device level functionality. </li>
</ul>

<p id="62">
The device layer is <em>not</em> intended to be called directly,
except by strategies for higher-level API interfaces that conform to
strategy rules. Such APIs should be very lightweight and fast so that
there is no need or temptation to call the device-layer
directly. Creators of such higher-level APIs must be especially
careful to understand the buffering issues involved, including those
described in <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> and 
<a href="operators/excl/device-write.htm"><b>device-write</b></a>. 
</p>

<p id="63">
Note that the device layer can implement whatever kind of
connection it is set up to do. Usually this means that it
will talk directly to a file handle or file descriptor number.
However, the connection can be made to a stream of a different
type instead of directly to an operating-system level file.
By this means, Java style stream encapsulations can be created
by the device-level programmer.
</p>

Such encapsulation functionality is done automatically by some
functions provided as implementation helpers (see

The one exception to the buffer-unaware separation in <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/device-write.htm"><b>device-write</b></a> is when they receive a null

Under this circumstance the device-read/device-write method has a
little leeway; it must assume that the null buffer argument refers to
the appropriate buffer in the actual stream, and must retrieve that

buffer with another of the same size. Also, in the case of <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a>, the length of the

There are three modes of blocking behavior when writing items in a
sequence to a stream or filling a sequence with items read from a
stream. The issue is what to do when (for writing) the entire sequence
cannot be written and (for reading) the entire sequence cannot be
filled, but no EOF is encountered. (By `the entire sequence', we mean
that part specified by <i>start</i> and
<i>end</i> if those are supplied.) Here are the modes
and a description of what happens in that mode if the whole operation
does not complete and no EOF is encountered.

<hr><h2 id="268"><a name="endian-swap-3">5.2.2 The endian-swap keyword argument to read-vector and write-vector</a></h2>

<p id="269">
The <em>endian-swap</em> keyword argument to <a href="operators/excl/read-vector.htm"><b>read-vector</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/write-vector.htm"><b>write-vector</b></a> allows the byte-ordering to be
controlled so as to allow big-endian and little-endian machines to
communicate with each other. Each version of Allegro CL has either
<code>:big-endian</code> or <code>:little-endian</code> on
its <code>*features*</code> list to identify it
appropriately. The <em>endian-swap</em> argument is effective only in
reads into and writes from vectors that are not strings, and is
silently ignored if given when a string is being passed to <a href="operators/excl/read-vector.htm"><b>read-vector</b></a> or
<a href="operators/excl/write-vector.htm"><b>write-vector</b></a>.
</p>

<p id="270">
There are three kinds of values that can be given to the
<em>endian-swap</em> argument:
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="271">A number, which designates a value to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/logandlo.htm"><b>logxor</b></a> 
    into the byte index of the vector being accessed. See the table and 
    discussion below for more information</li>
  <li id="272">The values <code>:byte-8</code>, <code>:byte-16</code>,
    <code>:byte-32</code>, <code>:byte-64</code>, or 
    <code>:byte-128</code> to indicate the width of the element 
    whose bytes to
    reverse. For example, <code>:byte-16</code> swaps every pair of 
    bytes,
    and <code>:byte-32</code> swaps every group of 4 bytes. 
    Note that <code>:byte-8</code> does nothing to the byte-ordering, 
    and is included only
    for symmetry.</li>
  <li id="273">The value <code>:network-order</code>. This value does nothing on
    big-endian machines, and on little-endian machines, causes bytes to be 
    swapped based on
    the element-size of the vector being read into or written from. 
    For example, a
    double-float vector, which has an element width of 64 bits, 
    is swapped on a <code>:byte-64</code> basis on a little-endian 
    machine.</li>
</ul>

<p id="274">
The byte-swapping mechanism relies on the fact that objects are always
aligned on 8 or 16 byte boundaries, depending on whether the lisp is a
32-bit or 64-bit lisp. Therefore, it is inadvisable to specify a
numeric value of greater than 7 (in a 32-bit lisp) or 15 (in a 64-bit
lisp).
</p>

<p id="275">
The byte swapping mechanism is in fact implemented by performing a
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/logandlo.htm"><b>logxor</b></a> on the current index of the next byte to get
out of the vector. The resultant <strong>xor</strong>'ed index is used
as the true byte index into the array. No attempt is made to ensure
that the index is valid (within range): it is the user's
responsibility to ensure that. This is always ensured if the
endian-swap specification matches the element width of the vector
(e.g. an <code>(unsigned-byte 16)</code> vector is
given an <em>endian-swap</em> value of <code>:byte-16</code>, 
or a double-float vector is given an endian-swap
value of <code>:byte-64</code>).
</p>

<p id="276">
The following table shows how the bytes actually appear after
swapping. Since the swapping is symmetrical, it can be used in either
direction, for both reading and writing.  Given the natural byte order
of bytes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H to start, the table shows the byte
order of the resultant bytes for some example cases:
</p>

<pre id="277">
name           value           order

:byte-8           0    A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H

<hr><h2 id="278"><a name="force-finish-output-2">5.3 Force-output and finish-output policy</a></h2>

<p id="279">
There is no explicit requirement by the ANSI CL Spec for an
implementation to provide <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a> calls automatically; the
programmer is always responsible for providing enough of these calls
to ensure that output is seen at its final destination in a timely
manner.  However, it is also counter to good stream optimization
techniques to call <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a>; the positive effects of buffering
are reduced when flushed by these functions.
</p>
<p id="280">
Allegro CL provides minimal <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> calls when certain operations are
performed, especially on interactive streams.  But not all operations
cause <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> calls.  It
might be confusing to observe that <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-st.htm"><b>write-line</b></a> will flush the output to an
interactive stream, but that <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-st.htm"><b>write-string</b></a> will not do so.  The division is
simple, though, and can be explained easily.
</p>
<h4 id="281">
Interactive Streams:
</h4>

<p id="282">
An interactive stream is specifically defined in Allegro CL as one for
which <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/interact.htm"><b>interactive-stream-p</b></a>
returns true. In Allegro CL <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/interact.htm"><b>interactive-stream-p</b></a> is <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a>'able, so any stream can in fact be
interactive. Usually, it makes most sense to set this attribute on a
stream that will act as a listener.
</p>

<h4 id="283">
Interactive force-output:
</h4>

<p id="284">
An interactive force-output is an operation that calls <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> on a stream if and only
if the stream is interactive. If the stream is not interactive, no
force output is done.
</p>

<h4 id="285">
Output-forcing activity:
</h4>

<p id="286">
Allegro CL attempts to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> as seldom as possible for minimal
acceptable buffer-flushing but with maximal buffer performance.
</p>

<ul>
<li id="287">
In functions described in <a href="#cl-funs-2">Section 5.1 Implementation of Common Lisp Functions for simple-streams</a>,
generally no <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a>
operations are done.  This excludes <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/close.htm"><b>close</b></a>, which by virtue of the <a href="operators/excl/device-close.htm"><b>device-close</b></a> after method performs a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> if the
<i>abort</i> argument is false. It also obviously
excludes <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> and
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a>, which start or
perform the buffer flushing explicitly.
</li>
<li id="288">
All functions listed in <a href="#higher-level-1">Section 6.0 Higher Level functions</a>
will perform an interactive <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a>, that is, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> will be called if and only if the
stream is interactive, after the outermost such function is finished.
If recursive printing is done using <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> methods, no flushing is done unless
explicitly requested, except when the outermost <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method is done (or when the
higher-level caller of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> has finished).
</li>
<li id="289">
Whenever <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/format.htm"><b>format</b></a>
is called on an interactive-stream, a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> is performed after the format
string is processed.
</li>
<li id="290">
Some top-level functions which aid the read-eval-print-loop
functionality will call <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> regardless of whether the stream is
interactive or not (usually it is the case that the stream is
interactive).
</li>
</ul>
<p id="291">
No other calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> are guaranteed by
Allegro CL, although such <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> calls might be inserted when
deemed necessary.  However, the general guideline that Allegro CL
follows is that in most cases a redundant <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> call is not
good, and is thus usually avoided.

<hr><hr><h2 id="309"><a name="ss-class-hierarchy-1">7.0 Simple-stream Class Hierarchy</a></h2>

<p id="310">
The class hierarchy for streams starts with <code>stream</code>
at the head, and implementations which include other stream classes
such as Gray streams will place those stream classes as subclasses of
<code>stream</code>. In Allegro CL, the only subclasses of
<code>stream</code> are <code>simple-stream</code> and
<code>fundamental-stream</code>.
<code>fundamental-stream</code> denotes a Gray stream.
</p>

<p id="311">
The <code>simple-stream</code> class hierarchy is divided into
three fundamental simple-stream classes (which in turn have subclasses
not listed in the diagram), based on the kinds of buffering they do:
</p>

<pre id="312">
          --&gt; fundamental-stream ...

<p id="316">
The basic behavior of the Common Lisp functions is described in
<a href="#cl-funs-2">Section 5.1 Implementation of Common Lisp Functions for simple-streams</a>. That description should be
taken on an as-if basis, which means that the specific functions
described may not actually be called at all, or else they might be
implemented using compiler-macros to call lower-level functions after
type inferencing proofs have been established (in other words, the
implementation works as if it was implemented as described). However,
the device-level interface does not have this freedom; those methods
applicable for the stream class <em>must</em> be called in the way
specified. This is to guarantee to the device-writer that methods that
are written for a particular purpose will indeed be called.
</p>

<p id="317">

the strategy used. Listed below are various sets of functions that are

<hr><hr><h2 id="325"><a name="control-chars-1">9.0 Control-character Processing</a></h2>

<p id="326">
Whenever a control character (one whose <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/char-co0.htm"><b>char-code</b></a> is less than 32) is seen when reading
or writing on a stream, a decision must be made as to what to do with
these characters. In a "raw" environment, the characters are
processed as themselves; when writing they are inserted into the
buffer (possibly after translation to octet form) and when reading
they are simply returned as Lisp characters (possibly after having
been assembled from octet form). In a "cooked" environment,
at least some control characters turn into instructions at the device
level, and are not inserted into or extracted from the stream as
characters.
</p>

<p id="327">
An example of this is <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/terprifr.htm"><b>terpri</b></a>, which is simply a
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-ch.htm"><b>write-char</b></a> of a #\Newline. On a terminal stream, a
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/terprifr.htm"><b>terpri</b></a> simply sends the #\Newline as a character
(though its sending may require a column indicator in the stream to be
set to 0 as well). However, a window stream should not see a #\Newline
at the device-level, instead the action should be to "move the
cursor down one line and to the far left side of the
window". 
</p>

<p id="328">
The simple-streams design allows for both of these kinds of
action. Each stream has two slots, a <em>control-in</em> slot and a
<em>control-out</em> slot, which may contain tables of functions that
are consulted when the character being read or written is determined
to be a control character. The actions taken are as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li id="329">If the control-out table has a function entry for the 
      control-character being written,
      that function is called with two arguments: the stream 
      and the character. The control-out
      function should perform whatever work that it is required 
      to do, and return non-nil,
      meaning that it is finished processing that character, or 
      else <code>nil</code>, which means that the
      normal character processing action is taken which inserts 
      the character into the stream. </li>
    <li id="330">If the control-in table has a function entry for 
     the control-character that has just
      been read out of the stream, that function is called with 
      two arguments: the stream and
      the character. The required actions are taken, and the 
      function returns a new character to
      substitute (or the old character), or it may return 
      <code>nil</code> 
      to indicate end-of-file. Note that the control-in handler must 
      not try to do any reading from the stream at all; the intention 
      for the control-in handler is to translate an already-received 
      character to another, or to perform an operation and return a 
      character. For ligatures and other multiple-character inputs, 
      a composing external-format should be used or created, or else 
      an encapsulation created for such translations.
    </li>
  </ul>

be taken as a guide for other implementations as well. 
</p>

<hr><h2 id="339"><a name="defining-new-classes-2">10.1 Defining new stream classes</a></h2>

<p id="340">
New stream classes may be created which subclass existing classes. If
the superclass chosen is a currently instantiable class, such as
terminal-simple-stream, file-simple-stream, etc., then the device
methods may be used as they are, or they may be called by
<strong>call-next-method</strong> by the more specialized method. If
the superclass chosen is one of the three major streams
(single-channel-simple-stream, dual-channel-simple-stream, or
string-simple-stream) then much of the device functionality will have
to be written from scratch. There may be some methods that exist to
provide defaults (for example, the default <a href="operators/excl/device-buffer-length.htm"><b>device-buffer-length</b></a> method specializes on
simple-stream to provide a default for all simple-streams). Other
methods, such as <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a>, have no appropriate default
action, and are thus not supplied. 
</p>

<p id="341">
To define a new stream class in Allegro CL, the <em>iodefs</em> module

information on raw mode). The flag bits are accessed 
very quickly to determine what kind
of stream it is: gray or simple, single/dual/string,

<p id="363">
Note that the supplied <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/device-write.htm"><b>device-write</b></a> functions do not generate errors

A charpos slot exists in every simple-stream.  Accessors are

When the charpos slot is non-<code>nil</code>, character
output functionalities have the effect of incrementing <a href="operators/excl/charpos.htm"><b>charpos</b></a>. In many streams, a newline

For fastest write operations, charpos should be set to <code>nil</code> by <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a>, and no

<hr><hr><h2 id="400"><a name="encapsulating-streams-1">12.0 Encapsulating Streams</a></h2>


<p id="401">
Much of this document, <i>streams.htm</i>, discusses
CLOS techniques for customizing streams. Allegro CL supports another
way to customize streams: encapsulation.  Encapsulation is a kind of
filtering approach; data flows through various streams which have been
attached end-to-end, and those data are processed and possibly
transformed at each stream stage. Encapsulation is a more modular
approach. Each component stream can be simpler and, therefore, more
widely applicable.
</p>

<p id="402">
Both encapsulation and CLOS specialization techniques are compatible with
each other, and can be used in combination to greatly enhance the data
processing capabilities in Allegro CL.
</p>

<p id="403">
In the following subsections we describe stream encapsulation and provide
some examples.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="404"><a name="encapsulation-terminology-2">12.1 Encapsulation terminology</a></h2>

<p id="405">
We define the terms used in this section:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="406">
<b>Encapsulation</b>, <b>encapsulator</b>, <b>encapsulate</b>,
<b>encapsulatee</b>: An <b>encapsulation</b> is the attachment of more
than one stream of any class in a chain, beginning with the i/o device
and ending with the program. A stream X is said to <b>encapsulate</b> a
stream Y when stream Y appears as stream X's input-handle or
output-handle. In this case, stream X is the <b>encapsulator</b> and stream
Y is the <b>encapsulated</b> stream or the <b>encapsulatee</b>.
</li>
<li id="407">
<b>Input direction</b> and <b>output direction</b>: The <b>input
direction</b> has data moving from the i/o device to the program.  The
<b>output direction</b> has data moving from the program to the i/o
device. These are obvious definitions, but are needed as reminders of
the definitions of inner and outer, given next, which may be less
intuitive.
</li>
<li id="408">
<b>Inner</b> and <b>outer</b>: The <b>inner</b>most encapsulator is
the stream which is closest to the program. The <b>outer</b>most
encapsulator is the stream which encapsulates the closest stream to
the i/o device (note that the closest stream to the i/o device is not
an encapsulator). This naming may seem counterintuitive, since an
encapsulator is inside (inner with respect to) the stream it
encapsulates. Normal usage would have an encapsulator outside its
encapsulatee, but viewing the whole process, inner more usefully
describes closer to the program and further from the i/o device.
</li>
</ul>



<hr><h2 id="409"><a name="encapsulation-strategy-2">12.2 Strategy descriptions necessary for encapsulation</a></h2>

<p id="410">
There are several slots in Allegro CL simple-streams which must be
exposed in order for encapsulations to be allowed.  The names of these
slots are not (typically) exported. Here we describe those slots
here, and their accessors, if they are defined.
</p>
<p id="411">
<code>excl::input-handle</code>,
<code>excl::output-handle</code>: These slots hold either fixnum
values representing operating system file numbers, or else streams
which are the encapsulated stream, or else <code>nil</code>.  The handle slot for each direction must match
the capability of the stream; i.e. if a stream is not open for input,
input-handle must be <code>nil</code>.  If the stream
changes states while open, the handles must follow that state; e.g. if
one direction of a socket stream is shut down, that corresponding
handle must be set to <code>nil</code>.  Accessors
<b>excl::stream-input-handle</b> and <b>excl::stream-output-handle
are</b> provided for these slots.
</p>
<p id="412">
<code>excl::melded-stream</code>,
<code>excl::melding-base</code>: These slots always hold
streams, and allow for the special encapsulation style of composing
external-formats.  See
<a href="#encap-composing-formats-2">Section 12.5 Encapsulating composing external-formats</a> for further
explanations.
</p>
<p id="413">
<code>excl::buffer</code>, <code>excl::out-buffer</code>:
These are the buffer slots.  The out-buffer slot is used when two
buffers might be used, to hold output data.  The buffer slot is not
called <i>in-buffer</i> because it sometimes acts as a bidirectional
buffer; when there is only one buffer in the stream the buffer slot is
the one that is used.  The exception to this rule is for <a href="classes/excl/string-output-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-output-simple-stream</code></a> which
does use out-buffer.  This allows streams to be subclassed on both
<a href="classes/excl/string-input-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-input-simple-stream</code></a> and <a href="classes/excl/string-output-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-output-simple-stream</code></a>,
without the stratagies clashing for the two directions.  No accessors
are exported for these slots.
</p>
<p id="414">
<code>excl::buffer-ptr</code>,
<code>excl::max-out-pos</code>: These are the buffer maximums.
When a device-read returns a number of octets read, the strategy
usually adds the value to the start value it gave to <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> and sets buffer-ptr to that value.
And for a dual-channel stream, max-out-pos is usually set at <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> time to the
length of the buffer.
</p>
<p id="415">
There are a couple of differences between
<code>buffer-ptr</code> and <code>max-out-pos</code>,
which might suggest the reason for the different names given them:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="416">
<code>max-out-pos</code> is usually set once, and not touched
again.  <code>buffer-ptr</code> is generally set before and/or
after a <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="417">
<code>max-out-pos</code> always holds one greater than the
current maximum index, whereas <code>buffer-ptr</code> might hold
a -1 (representing an eof).
</li>
</ul>

<p id="418">
<code>excl::buffpos</code>, <code>excl::outpos</code>:
These slots hold indices into buffer and out-buffer vectors,
respectively.  Ignoring overflows for the moment, the basic <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-byt.htm"><b>read-byte</b></a> operation consists simply of
doing an aref of the buffer at buffpos position, followed by an
increment of buffpos.  Likewise, the basic write-byte operation (on a
dual-channel stream) consists of a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> of the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/aref.htm"><b>aref</b></a> of out-buffer at out-pos,
followed by an increment of out-pos.
</p>
<p id="419">
[Note: <code>excl::buffer</code>,
<code>excl::buffpos</code>, and
<code>excl::buffer-ptr</code> are defined for all
simple-streams. <code>excl::out-buffer</code>,
<code>excl::outpos</code>, and
<code>excl::max-out-pos</code> are only defined for streams
for which it makes sense, i.e. dual-channel and string-output
simple-streams.]
</p>
<p id="420">
To make the octet and character strategy work as efficiently as
possible, the buffpos/buffer-ptr and out-pos/max-out-pos pairs
must always retain numeric values, and if there is any data
remaining in buffer to be read or if there is any room in
out-buffer for writing, the position slot will be less than the
max slot.  The complete basic strategy for reading and writing
an octet takes advantage of this fact to provide a single-test
instruction sequence for determining if the next character can
be read (for which the answer should normally be "yes").  Thus,
for example, a template for strategy to read an octet has the
following form (in unoptimized lisp pseudocode):
</p>
<pre id="421">
 (when (&gt;= (sm buffpos stream) (sm buffer-ptr stream))
   ;; Buffer needs filling
   [various operations which may include device-read])
 (prog1
     (aref (sm buffer stream) (sm buffpos stream))
   (incf (sm buffpos stream)))
</pre>
<p id="422">
<code>excl::last-char-read-size</code>,
<code>excl::encapsulated-char-read-size</code>: These two slots
determine how much of the octet buffer constitutes a character for the
purposes of unreading that character, and how much to copy back of the
buffer contents to the beginning of the buffer before reading (via
<a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a>) into
the rest of the buffer. These slots always hold numeric values, and
are reset to 0 by many synchronizing operations.
</p>

<h3 id="423">The strategy function slots</h3>

<p id="424">
The slots listed below hold character-strategy functions, which can be
built in any way desired, but which conform to the requirements of
their respective functionality descriptions.  Allegro CL internally uses the <a href="operators/excl/char-to-octets.htm"><b>char-to-octets</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/octets-to-char.htm"><b>octets-to-char</b></a> macros to incorporate
external-format processing as part of the stream's character-strategy
functionality.
</p>
<h4 id="425">excl::j-listen</h4>
<p id="426">
Holds a function which expects one
argument which is the stream.  The function returns <code>nil</code> if a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> would hang, and non-<code>nil</code> if <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> would not hang.  Note that the name
<i>j-listen</i> does not imply Common Lisp functionality, which tends
to be inconsistent in its definition for listening, especially in the
face of multi-octet characters.  Instead,
<b>j-listen</b> is precisely defined to determine
whether a complete character can be read by <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> (or if an error or an EOF might occur)
and would probably better have been named <i>j-no-hang-p</i> instead.
This also implies that in a multibyte character situation where only
part of the character has become available, the
<b>j-listen</b> function must return <code>nil</code> even if some of the octets were readable.
</p>
<p id="427">
The <b>j-listen</b> function must always leave the stream
in the same state as it started, including the unread-char
character-length, so that an <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unread-c.htm"><b>unread-char</b></a> could be performed
after a listen.
</p>
<h4 id="428">excl::j-read-char</h4>
<p id="429">
Holds a function which receives
the following arguments: <i>stream eof-error-p eof-value
blocking</i>.
</p>
<p id="430">
The <i>stream</i>, <i>eof-error-p</i>, and
<i>eof-value</i> arguments have the same semantics of
similarly named arguments to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a>.  The <i>blocking</i>
argument determines whether the operation may block; a <code>nil</code> value causes the equivalent behavior as <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-ch0.htm"><b>read-char-no-hang</b></a>, and a non-<code>nil</code> value causes <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> behavior.  Either enough
octets are read to be converted to a character, or a character is
read, and returned.
</p>
<h4 id="431">excl::j-write-char</h4>
<p id="432">
Holds a function which receives
the following arguments: <i>character stream</i>.

<p id="433">
The <i>character</i> and <i>stream</i>
arguments have the same semantics as similarly named arguments to
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-ch.htm"><b>write-char</b></a>.  The
<b>j-write-char</b> function is always assumed to be
a blocking write (i.e. if writing cannot be done temporarily due to
resource limitations, the function will wait for the resources to
become freed). The character is written to the stream's buffer, after
being converted to octets via the external-format, if the stream is
octet-oriented. The character is returned from the function.
</p>
<h4 id="434">excl::j-read-chars</h4>
<p id="435">
Holds a function which receives
the following arguments: <i>stream string search start end
blocking</i>.
</p>
<p id="436">
The <i>stream</i>, <i>start</i>, and
<i>end</i> arguments have similar semantics as similarly
named arguments to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-seq.htm"><b>read-sequence</b></a>.  The <i>string</i>
argument can be any string, and is the string which will be filled
with the characters formed either by reading the next character, or by
reading of octets and converting to characters via the external format
of the stream.
</p>
<p id="437">
If <i>search</i> is <code>nil</code>, then
only as many characters as can be read are in fact read, and 1 plus
the index of the last character read is returned as the only
value. (This document used to say the number of characters
read was returned, but that was incorrect.) 
</p>
<p id="438">
If <i>search</i> is given, it should be a character.  As
each character is read, it is compared to the search value. If the
character read doesn't match, it is transferred to the string, but if
it matches, the reading stops with the matching character being
consumed but not transferred to the string. At that time, the index of
the next character to read is returned as the first value, and the
second value returned is based on the success of the search; the three
possible second values are <code>nil</code> (search
character was not found), <code>t</code> (search character
found), or :eof (end-of-file encountered). (This document used
to say the number of characters transferred was returned, but that was
incorrect.) 
</p>
<p id="439">
The <i>blocking</i> argument determines what kind of
blocking to perform.  A value of <code>nil</code> causes
no blocking.  A value of <code>t</code> causes blocking to
always occur, and the operation will either complete or get an error.
A value of :bnb causes blocking for the first character, but
non-blocking for subsequent characters.

<h4 id="440">excl::j-write-chars</h4>

<p id="445">
Holds a function which
receives the following arguments: <i>stream relaxed</i>.
</p>
<p id="446">
The <i>stream</i> argument has similar semantics as the
stream argument to unread-char.  The <i>relaxed</i>
argument allows the unread to be performed without error, even if the
last-char-read-size is 0.  Normally, the only time that this will be
necessary is when a hard or soft eof has been encountered during a
multi-character composition, in which case the eof must be unread.
</p>
<p id="447">
The <b>j-unread-char</b> function backs up one character in the stream.
If the stream is an encapsulator, then this may mean backing up
several characters in the stream it encapsulates.
</p>
<p id="448">
For an octet-based stream, the last-char-read-size of the stream
will determine how many octets to back up in the buffer in order
to unread the character.  That slot is set in one of two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="449">
it is incremented during the building of a character.
</li>
<li id="450">
it is set by an encapsulating stream which has read one or more
characters in order to compose a character at a higher level.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="451">
The protocols for setting and incrementing this slot ensure that
the two methods do not conflict with each other.
</p>
<p id="452">
Note that there is no character argument to this <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unread-c.htm"><b>unread-char</b></a> implementation.  Due to the

specifying an eof condition as a unique character (for the puroposes
of unreading) the Allegro CL implementation of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unread-c.htm"><b>unread-char</b></a> does not actually use the character

<hr><h2 id="462"><a name="octet-char-connections-2">12.3 Valid connections between octet-oriented and character-oriented streams</a></h2>

<p id="463">
Both <a href="classes/excl/single-channel-simple-stream.htm"><code>single-channel-simple-stream</code></a>s and <a href="classes/excl/dual-channel-simple-stream.htm"><code>dual-channel-simple-stream</code></a>s are
octet-oriented, that is, they employ octet buffers internally.  String
streams are character-oriented streams, which means that their
internal buffers are strings.  Various implications can be made from
these definitions, and these implications affect how encapsulations
can be made:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="464">
An octet-oriented stream can read or write both binary data and
character data, but a character oriented stream cannot read or write
binary data.  So, in effect, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> works on an octet-oriented stream (via
the stream's installed character strategy) but <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-byt.htm"><b>read-byte</b></a> does not work on a string
</li>
<li id="465">
A character-oriented stream is never attached to an external device.
This is because a Lisp string has internal representations that are
not necessarily translatable to external foreign string formats.
</li>
<li id="466">
The previous implication further implies that a character-oriented
stream generally does not use an external-format.  The external-format
slot of the stream exists in a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/string-s.htm"><code>string-stream</code></a>, but is not used for
any of the defined character-strategies; the point of string streams
is to bypass overhead needed to transform characters into octets and
back again.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="467">
Encapsulations can be set up in a couple of ways.  If we label
character-oriented streams with the letter <b>C</b>, and octet-oriented
streams with the letter <b>O</b>, then the following kinds of encapsulation
configurations can be done:
</p>
<pre id="468">
Simple unencapsulated string stream:

  prog - <b>C</b> - string

Simple unencapsulated octet stream, externally connected:

  prog - <b>O</b> - i/o

Simple unencapsulated octet stream, internally connected:

  prog - <b>O</b> - octet-buffer

Encapsulations on internally connected string streams:

  prog - <b>C</b> - <b>C</b> - ... - <b>C</b> - string

Encapsulations on internally connected octet streams:

  prog - <b>C</b> - <b>C</b> - ... - <b>C</b> - <b>O</b> - ... - <b>O</b> - buffer

Encapsulations on externally connected octet streams:

  prog - <b>C</b> - <b>C</b> - ... - <b>C</b> - <b>O</b> - ... - <b>O</b> - i/o
</pre>
<p id="469">
In other words, a character oriented stream may encapsulate any
kind of stream, and an octet-oriented stream may be encapsulated
by any kind of stream, but an octet-oriented stream cannot
encapsulate a character-oriented stream.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="470"><a name="encapsulation-examples-2">12.4 Examples of stream encapsulations</a></h2>

<p id="471">
Three examples are provided, which show how to encapsulate streams in
different styles.  (Only two of the examples are fully worked out.)
The first shows a string-stream which uses two buffers and which thus
allows bidirectional communication on dual-channel encapsulatees.  The
second is a single-buffer string stream which nevertheless allows
bidirectional data to and from a single-channel stream like a file.
The third example demonstrates an octet-based encapsulator, and it
also demonstrated the ability to pick off bits in a stream and divide
or combine them for presentation as octets in a stream at a higher
level.
</p>
<p id="472">
All of these examples share some common features:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="473">
The code is set in the :user package.  In real user-defined
encapsulations, any package can be created and used for the
implementation.  Do not use the :excl package, since that is
our Allegro CL implementation package.
</li>
<li id="474">
The :iodefs module is needed at compile-time, to define several of the
macros used in the code. Note that since it is a
compile-time require, the module is not necessary for normal runtime.
However, you can load the module by evaluating
<code>(require :iodefs)</code>.
</li>
<li id="475">
The encapsulatee is specified by the :base-stream argument.  That
choice of name is arbitrary. The base-stream is obtained from the
options argument to each <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> method.  It is up to <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> to do any keyword
checking that it wants to do.  In the examples, the existance of the
base-stream keyword it the only thing checked; any other keywords are
ignored, as if by :allow-other-keys.
</li>
<li id="476">
The setting of one or both handle slots to the base-stream is what
establishes the connection to the "device" (in this case, another
stream).  Because the encapsulatee is an open stream, the connection
made by the setting of handles is what satisfies <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a>'s requirement to establish the
connection.
</li>
<li id="477">
One common error that a device-level programmer might make is to
forget to return a non-<code>nil</code> value from the
<a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> method.  This
will always result in a closed stream, since the shared-initialize
:after method on simple-streams always calls <a href="operators/excl/device-close.htm"><b>device-close</b></a> if the <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> method returns <code>nil</code>.
</li>
</ul>



<hr><h2 id="478"><a name="encap-example-rot13b-2">12.4.1 Rot13b: An Example of Bidirectional Stream Encapsulation</a></h2>



<p id="479">
Rot13 is a simple translation technique used many times to shield
internet readers from potentially offensive text.  The simple rule
is that alphabetic characters are shifted by exactly 13 characters
in the alphabet, whichever way is possible.  Because there are exactly
26 characters in the English alphabet, two such shifts will reproduce
the original result.  Thus the original text is easy to get, but it
takes a conscious act on the part of the reader to read such text.
</p>
<p id="480">
This encapsulation example uses a bidirectional string stream with
two buffers, and is intended to encapsulate another dual-buffer
stream (either another encapsulating dual-buffer string stream or a
dual-channel stream).
</p>
<p id="481">
First, an example run:
</p>
<pre id="482">

as <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/debug-io.htm"><code>*standard-input*</code></a> in
this example transcript.  This naturally causes the listener to wait
after each <code>(read-line xxx)</code> for the input, just as a

thing.  Such behavior would not be seen if the stream being

<p id="490">
This is the basic workhorse routine for rot13.  The input character is
rotated within the alphabet if it is an alphabetic character, and

Base64 encoding is part of the MIME specification as rfc1521 (see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1521.html</a>). It
uses a limited character set to textually encode data of any kind,

contributes to the universal usability of base64.  This encoding is
definitely not a compression technique; in fact data are expanded by
33% when decoded.

This encapsulation example demonstrates the capability of simple-streams

to 3 octets of converted data.  Any extra octets modulo 4 that have
been read are moved to the beginning of the raw buffer and are not
decoded until any further reads obtain the full 4-octet package.
</p>

<h3 id="508">

<p id="509">
This function calls <b>j-read-chars</b> to get as much data as possible,
up to the count (but not more than the raw-buffer size).  It loops
until it can't read anymore, or until it has filled at least some
data into the raw-data buffer.
</p>
<p id="510">
Any data that don't represent the actual base64 text are discarded.
This is done via a state machine, which must be primed and triggered
before the buffer is actually filled.  The primed slot is normally
<code>nil</code> when no base64 encoding is being done,
and is primed to the value 'primed by the function <b>prime-it</b>
(described below).  Once the stream is primed, a blank line is needed
to actually trigger the state machine and to put it into 'ready state,
after which the buffer can be filled.  Once the state is ready,
characters are read into the raw-buffer until either a #\Newline is
encountered, or until the state is changed again to <code>nil</code> by the occurrence either of another blank line or
a dash character ( #\- )

The state remains unchanged from call to call, in case no data (or even no

<p id="513">
This function's purpose is to match arbitrary input to the string
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64".  Such matching can be done one
character at a time or from multiple characters, using the
prime-count slot which keeps track of the current number of matched
characters from previous calls.  New data in the buffer argument
always starts at the 0th element.
</p>

<p id="514">
As it exists, the base64 example is a toy only.  There are a number
of things that might be done to make it less of a toy:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="515">
It should better parse headers, and not pass over non-base64
encodings (when other encodings are encountered, errors should be
generated).  Currently, the string "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64"
is the only thing that primes the stream for parsing. 
</li>
<li id="516">
It should make attempts to convert partial groupings of 4 octets, if
possible.  If only two octets are read out of the 4 octets required
for a 3-octet result, at least one result octet should be decodable.
Also, if 3 of the 4 octets are read, 2 result octets should be
decodable.  As it currently stands, this stream class waits until all
4 octets are read before decoding them, and will thus cause <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/listen.htm"><b>listen</b></a> to return <code>nil</code> in such a circumstance, even though at least one
of the result octets should have been decodable.
</li>
<li id="517">
The <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/file-pos.htm"><b>file-position</b></a> method
and its <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> method is
not specialized on this stream class.  It is not clear how <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/file-pos.htm"><b>file-position</b></a> should be
defined. One simplistic approach is to treat the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/file-pos.htm"><b>file-position</b></a> as transparent;
the <a href="operators/excl/device-file-position.htm"><b>device-file-position</b></a> simply returns the
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/file-pos.htm"><b>file-position</b></a> of the
encapsulatee.  However, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/file-pos.htm"><b>(setf file-position)</b></a> would pose a
problem for the priming state of the stream, since it would not be
known whether or not the new position is somewhere in the base64 data,
or in header or other non-base64 areas.
</li>
</ul>





<hr><h2 id="518"><a name="encap-composing-formats-2">12.5 Encapsulating composing external-formats</a></h2>

<p id="519">
It is possible to create composed external-formats using encapsulating
streams. (See <a href="iacl.htm#composed-efs-3">Composed
External-Formats</a> in <a href="iacl.htm">iacl.htm</a> for a
description of composed external-formats.) Encapsulated-based composed
external-formats operate by melding two or more streams together. This
is as opposed to macro-based composed external-formats, which operate
by combining the composer and composee external-format conversion
macros to create a single new external-format conversion
macro. Macro-based composed external-formats are defined using <a href="operators/excl/compose-external-formats.htm"><b>compose-external-formats</b></a>.  At this
time, functions similar to <a href="operators/excl/compose-external-formats.htm"><b>compose-external-formats</b></a> which define
encapsulated-based composed external-formats are not available, but
are planned for future Allegro CL releases.
</p>
<p id="520">
Allegro CL includes an encapsulated-based composing
external-format for translating Ascii return/linefeed octet codes into
Common Lisp #\Newline characters. This external-format is called
<b>:e-crlf</b>. Its implementation is described in detail in this
section.
</p>
<p id="521">
<a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a>
accepts a two-element
list argument. The first element names an encapsulated-based composer
external-format, and the second element names an external-format. Note
that the second element itself can be a list, thus recursively
denoting an inner composition.
</p>
<p id="522">
Thus, <code>(find-external-format '(:e-crlf </code><code>&nbsp;</code><code>
</code><code><i>:foo-base-ef</i></code><code>))</code> returns an encapsulated-based
external-format which is the same as the
<code><i>:foo-base-ef</i></code> external-format except that the
Common Lisp #\Newline character is converted to Ascii return/linefeed
codes and vice-versa. (Such external-formats are useful/necessary for
text files native to DOS/Windows which use the two Ascii octet
codes to terminate lines.)
</p>
<p id="523">
Because a stream's external-format can be switched dynamically, the style of stream
encapsulation for external-formats is much different than the normal encapsulation style
of attaching a stream handle. One reason for the difference is normal encapsulations can
cause identity confusion. If stream xxx is opened and then encapsulated by stream yyy,
then any variables that once referred to xxx would have to be changed to refer to yyy
instead. If a user does
</p>
<pre id="524">
(setf (stream-external-format xxx)
      (find-external-format '(:e-crlf &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>)))
</pre>
<p id="525">
or, equivalently,
</p>
<pre id="526">
(setf (stream-external-format xxx)
      '(:e-crlf &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>))
</pre>
<p id="527">
then the identity and class of the stream which xxx holds must not change.
</p>


<p id="528">
The melded-stream slot contains the next stream in a composition
instead of the handle slots in external-format encapsulation. And
besides that slot, the melding-base slot always contains the base
stream of the composition (which is the stream that retains its
identity no matter what the composition looks like).
</p>

<h3 id="529">Composed External-Format Description:</h3>

<h4 id="530">Composing stream class:</h4>

<p id="531">
The <a href="classes/excl/composing-stream.htm"><code>composing-stream</code></a>
class is introduced to implement the external-format composition.  It
has <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/string-s.htm"><code>string-stream</code></a> as
superclass, and has no extra slots.  An exception to the general rule
that all streams are buffered, composing-streams are not buffered
themselves, but read and write one character at a time; A
specialization on a <a href="classes/excl/composing-stream.htm"><code>composing-stream</code></a> might have tables to work
with, such as translation tables, in the same way that encapsulating
streams use them, but any buffering is done vicariously through its
base stream.
</p>

<h4 id="532">
Straw encapsulation model:</h4>

<p id="533">
It is easiest to explain the intricacies of the composing-external-format model by
demonstrating what the model would have looked like if the identity problem had not in
fact been a problem. Note that this entire section below is for demonstration purposes
only, and does not describe the actual composition structure.
</p>
<p id="534">
A composing-external-format like <code>(:e-crlf
</code><code>&nbsp;</code><code><i>:foo-base-ef</i></code><code>)</code> would have been
represented as two streams - a composing-external-format stream, whose
melded-stream and melding-base both contain the base stream. The
composing-external-format stream would contain the composing
external-format character strategy functions (in this case, for
example, the j-read-char slot would contain #'crlf-read-char) and the
base stream would contain its own strategy functions.
</p>



<p id="535">
Reading a character would consist of funcall'ing the j-read-char
function of the composing-stream.  That function, crlf-read-char,
would read and/or unread individual characters from the melded-stream
(i.e. the file stream) by funcalling the j-read-char and j-unread-char
functions of that stream as appropriate, and by then combining those
characters (this composing-external-format will combine #\Return
followed by #\Linefeed into a single #\Newline character). The
j-read-char functions of the file stream would get its characters in
the usual way, by operating on its own buffer (and possibly thus
calling one of the device functions).
</p>



<p id="536">
Although Allegro CL includes only two composing-formats,
<code>:e-crlf</code>; and the less commonly used
<code>:e-crcrlf</code> (see <a href="iacl.htm#newline-1">#\newline discussion</a> in
<a href="iacl.htm">iacl.htm</a> for more about the crcrlf
external-format), it is possible that new composing-formats will be
defined in the future. For example, if some kind of ligature combining
external-format called, say, <code>:e-ligature</code> were
created (though such a external-format currently does not exist) then
it could be combined with others via 
</p>
<pre id="537">
 (setf (stream-external-format xxx) '(:e-crlf (:e-ligature &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>)))
</pre>
<p id="538">
In our hypothetical architecture, we would have set this up as three
streams; if xxx is the stream with the
<code><i>:foo-base-ef</i></code> strategies and the buffer, and
yyy is the composing stream with crlf strategies, and if zzz is the
composing stream with the (hypothetical) ligature strategies, then the
above setf would attach the streams as follows:
</p>
<pre id="539">
  yyy -&gt; zzz -&gt; xxx
</pre>
<p id="540">
where the arrow represents the connection made by the melded-stream slot.  A
read-char on yyy would funcall yyy's j-read-char, which would combine
characters obtained by calling j-read-char on its melded-stream zzz, which
in turn would return characters formed by combining or expanding ligatures
recognized by reading characters from its melded-stream xxx, which finally
obtains its characters from its buffer (filling it if necessary).
</p>

<h4 id="541">
Actual encapsulation model:</h4>

<p id="542">
In reality, the above straw model using a hypothetical architecture
will not work, because the setting of external-formats should never
change the identity of a stream.  The above hypothetical architecture
requires that the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a> pass yyy as the stream, but identity
requirements need xxx to be the stream to be passed to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-cha.htm"><b>read-char</b></a>.  Thus, the real
model is somewhat convoluted; if we still keep our hypothetical
<code>:e-ligature</code> external-format, then if
</p>
<pre id="543">
 (setf (stream-external-format xxx) '(:e-crlf (:e-ligature &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>)))
</pre>
<p id="544">
is done, with xxx as the same base stream as before, and if we then say
</p>
<pre id="545">
 (with-stream-class (stream)
    (setq yyy (sm melded-stream xxx))
    (setq zzz (sm melded-stream yyy)))
</pre>
<p id="546">
then the following picture would apply:
</p>
<pre id="547">
 xxx -&gt; yyy -&gt; zzz
</pre>

<ol>
<li id="548">
xxx will still have a <a href="classes/excl/file-simple-stream.htm"><code>file-simple-stream</code></a> whose melding-base is
itself, and whose melded-stream is yyy.  Also, xxx's
character-strategy slots will be filled with
<code>:e-crlf</code> strategies
(e.g. <code>#'excl::crlf-read-char</code>, etc.)
</li>
<li id="549">
yyy will be the crlf composing-stream, whose melding-base will be xxx
and whose melded-stream will be zzz.  Its character-strategy functions
will be whatever were defined for the ligature external-format
(presumably named something like <b>ligature-read-char</b>, etc).
</li>
<li id="550">
zzz will be the (still hypothetical) ligature composing-stream,
whose melding-base will be xxx and whose melded-stream will also be
xxx.  It's character-strategy will be the strategy from the
file-simple-streams [in this case the read-char strategy is
<code>#'(efft sc-read-char </code><code>&nbsp;</code><code><i>:foo-base-ef</i></code><code>)</code>].
</li>
</ol>

<p id="551">
Finally, xxx's external-format slot will contain the results of
</p>
<pre id="552">
(find-external-format '(:e-crlf (:e-ligature &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>)))
</pre>
<p id="553">
and yyy's external-format slot will contain the results of
</p>
<pre id="554">
(find-external-format '(:e-ligature &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>))
</pre>
<p id="555">
and zzz's external-format slot will contain the results of
</p>
<pre id="556">
  (find-external-format &nbsp;<i>:foo-base-ef</i>)
</pre>
<p id="557">
The rotation of the strategy functions implies that all strategy
functions must be aware of the rotation and must consider where the
respective slots are in these cycles; all external-format related
slots (such as those for holding last character octet size and
external-format state information) are in the current stream, whereas
stream-related slots (such as buffers, pointers, etc) are in the
melded-stream (the next stream down in the cycle). Highest-level
functionlity such as <b>dribble</b>, control-handlers, etc, always remain in
the base stream.
</p>
<p id="558">
Note also that since this  kind of "melding" encapsulation is in
a different direction than regular encapsulation, the handles of
the base-stream are not modified and point to the next "real"
encapsulation outward.
</p>
<p id="559">
So all strategies everywhere take an indirection
through the melded-stream slot, to get to the next stream down for its
real operation.  A standard pattern of coding in use is
shown in this example:
</p>
<pre id="560">
(defun crlf-read-char (e-stream eof-error-p eof-value block)
    (with-stream-class (stream e-stream)
       (let ((stream (sm melded-stream e-stream))
    ...
</pre>
<p id="561">
So in fact the j-read-char in xxx is going to have xxx as e-stream,
and yyy as stream.
</p>
<p id="562">
As an example, consider the crlf algorithm:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="563">
Read a char
</li>
<li id="564">
Then
<ol>
<li id="565">
If the character is not #\Return, return the char and done.
</li>
<li id="566">
If eof was encountered, perform the requested eof processing.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="567">
Char is #\Return; read char (call it char2).
</li>
<li id="568">
Then
<ol>
<li id="569">
If char2 is eof, then return char.
</li>
<li id="570">
If char2 is #\Linefeed, return #\Newline
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="571">
Char is #\Return, but char2 is something else.  unread-char without
disturbing the ability to unread the #\Return.
</li>
<li id="572">
Return char, which is #\Return.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="573">
The crlf-read-char strategy does this by calling j-read-char and
j-unread-char on stream (rather than on e-stream).  Note that if there is
a third stage, yyy's strategies will be ligature strategies, but will
end up operating by calling j-read-char on zzz, which are in fact the
base-stream strategies.  Now, remembering that all strategies take the
indirection, the base-stream strategies will take the melded-stream slot
of zzz which is xxx, which has the buffers which these strategies
expect.

<hr><hr><h2 id="574"><a name="built-in-methods-1">Appendix A: Built-in stream methods and their uses</a></h2>

<p id="575">
There are built-in methods for stream classes. Some are described in
the following subsections.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="576"><a name="print-object-stream-method-2">Appendix A.1 The print-object built-in stream method</a></h2>

<p id="577">
The <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a>
method affects all Common Lisp objects, and streams are no different.
Of the two kinds of streams, Gray and Simple, the simple-streams usage
of print-object is the most involved.
</p>
<p id="578">
Some of the general items that might be printed in a stream
print-object method are listed by name in each individual description,
and might be:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="579">
<b>printing status</b>: if the stream has been manufactured
specifically for printing through another stream, then &quot;printing for
&lt;name&gt;&quot; is printed, where &lt;name&gt; is the name of the stream
for which this stream is gathering output. A pretty-printing (i.e. an
xp) stream is an example of a printing stream.
</li>
<li id="580">
<b>open status</b>: if the file is open, no special status is printed,
but if the file is only open for input or output, or else is closed,
that status is included in the printing of the stream.
</li>
<li id="581">
<b>position</b>: if file-position information is appropriate (even if
the stream does not represent an actual file) then &quot;pos: &lt;n&gt;&quot; is
printed where &lt;n&gt; is a file position.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="582">
The action of the method on different stream classes is an follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="583">
<b>Gray streams</b> (see <a href="gray-streams.htm">gray-streams.htm</a>: most
Gray streams use the default <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method, which prints the
class of the stream (unreadably, with its address identity). For
streams which are also instances
of <code>excl::file-gray-stream</code>
or <code>excl::socket-stream</code>, the general items (listed
above -- printing status, open status and position) are also printed.
</li>
<li id="584">
<b>Simple-streams</b>: there is a method on <a href="classes/excl/simple-stream.htm"><code>simple-stream</code></a> which is the default
simple-stream method; it prints the stream unreadably with the text
"[not completely built]". This method should always be overridden; its
presence indicates a missing <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method on the
simple-stream class. Most simple-streams have their own print-object
methods, which will only include the "[not completely built]" text if
the stream does not yet have the correct state after
the <a href="operators/excl/device-open.htm"><b>device-open</b></a> method has
fully completed its tasks.  If there is not a print-object method for
that simple-stream class, however, this default method indicates that
the stream is not (and will never be) completely built - it represents
a design error in the simple-stream class.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="585">
The three major subclasses of <a href="classes/excl/simple-stream.htm"><code>simple-stream</code></a> treat print-object
slightly differently:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="586">
<b><a href="classes/excl/dual-channel-simple-stream.htm"><code>dual-channel-simple-stream</code></a></b>: this class is
listed first because it has a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method directly on it; no
print-object methods need be provided for subclasses of dual-channel
simple-streams. This print-object method prints the relevant general
items listed above: printing status and open status (position is
never printed in a dual-channel stream because dual-channel streams
don't tend to have positions). In addition, if the stream has an
input or output handle (or both) they are printed as &quot;fd:
&lt;handle(s)&gt;&quot; where &lt;handle(s)&gt; is one or both handles
separated by /.
</li>
<li id="587">
<b><a href="classes/excl/single-channel-simple-stream.htm"><code>single-channel-simple-stream</code></a></b>: because
single-channel streams are so diverse, there is not one style of
printing that can handle all situations, so of the
single-channel-simple-streams listed
in <a href="#simple-stream-hierarchy-illus-1">Section 11.0 The simple-stream class hierarchy illustrated</a>,
only the following (and their subclasses) have <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> methods; if subclassing on
any other single-channel stream is desired, a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method may need to be
provided as part of the stream implementation:
<ul>
<li id="588">
<b><a href="classes/excl/file-simple-stream.htm"><code>file-simple-stream</code></a></b>:
this method provides the general items: printing status, open status,
position, as well as the filename and "mapped" if the file is a mapped
file.
</li>
<li id="589">
<a href="classes/excl/direct-simple-stream.htm"><code>direct-simple-stream</code></a>:
those direct-simple-streams which are not also mapped-files tend to be
buffer streams. The <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a> method for these streams
is simplistic, providing only printing-status and position if
applicable.  More complex direct simple-streams should provide their
own print-object methods.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="590">
<b><a href="classes/excl/probe-simple-stream.htm"><code>probe-simple-stream</code></a></b>: although this class
is a subclass of <a href="classes/excl/file-simple-stream.htm"><code>file-simple-stream</code></a>, it only prints the
filename.
</li>
<li id="591">
<b><a href="classes/excl/string-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-simple-stream</code></a></b>: although it might
seem that <a href="classes/excl/string-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-simple-stream</code></a>s should be consistent,
they are not; the class is the only class which provides completely
transparent transfer of characters between the API and the device. So
only those streams which are listed below (and their subclasses) have
print-object methods:
<ul>
<li id="592">
<b><a href="classes/excl/string-input-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-input-simple-stream</code></a></b>: provides only
the position general item (of the general items listed above). In
addition, a sample of the current contents of the string buffer is
printed as a string; if the string is 15 characters or longer, ... is
printed at the end.
</li>
<li id="593">
<a href="classes/excl/string-output-simple-stream.htm"><code>string-output-simple-stream</code></a>: provides only the
position general item (of the general items listed above). In
addition, the printing status general item is provided, but instead of
showing an underlying handle, the actual string being built is shown,
with elipses for strings 15 characters or more.
</li>
<li id="594">
<b><a href="classes/excl/composing-stream.htm"><code>composing-stream</code></a></b>:
provides only the position general item (of the general items listed
above). Also, if the stream has a handle it prints &quot;encapsulated by
&lt;encapsulator&gt;&quot; where &lt;encapsulator&gt; is the stream
encapsulating this one. Also, if the encapsulating stream is a file or
socket, the name is included.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>




<hr><hr><h2 id="595"><a name="peek-byte-1">Appendix B: peek-byte and unread-byte</a></h2>

<p id="596">
Ever since the inception of simple-streams, there has been a small
need for the capability to unread individual octets from a stream.
When the Ansi CL spec was being develped around 1990, multi-octet
characters were a relatively new concept, and so Common Lisp still
held to the concept that the charater was the basic unit of data
transfer, and that the "byte" was a variable size.  But nowadays, the
roles have reversed, and we tend to use the term "octet" (8-bit byte)
to refer to what most people think of as bytes, and characters have
become the larger unit, sometimes taking 3, 4, or even more octets to
encode in various encoding systems, which are handled in Allegro CL by
external-formats.
</p>
<p id="597">
We have always had the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/peek-cha.htm"><b>peek-char</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unread-c.htm"><b>unread-char</b></a> functions, and because there is at
least one external-format (named :latin1-base, also nicknamed :octets)
which upon reading draws a one-to-one correspondence between
characters and octets, so that <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/peek-cha.htm"><b>peek-char</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/unread-c.htm"><b>unread-char</b></a> can be used indirectly to peek at
and unread bytes.  However, in situations where external-formats other
than :latin1-base are being used by default, this poses the
inconvenience of having to switch external-formats to latin1-base and
then back again every time it is desired to unread a single octet.  So
these two functions are provided which act on octets only and which do
not require an external-format change:
</p>
<ul>

<a href="operators/excl/peek-byte.htm"><b>peek-byte</b></a>
