A timer can be used to cause an arbitrary piece of application code to
be asynchronously invoked after a specified amount of time has
elapsed. A timer can then be stopped in order to run its code a single
time only, or it can be allowed to continue running in order to run
its code an indefinite number of times at a regular time interval.
</p><p id="4">
Common Graphics has a <a href="../classes/cg/timer.htm"><code>timer</code></a> class, which can
be instantiated to create a timer object. A single timer can be
started and stopped a number of times, using various time intervals,
to time a number of different activities. If multiple activities need
to be timed simultaneously, then multiple timers can be created and
run alongside each other. It is also convenient to create a separate
timer for each piece of code that is to be invoked by timers, even
when they do not need to run simultaneously.
</p><p id="5">
A timer is an instance of the <a href="../classes/cg/timer.htm"><code>timer</code></a> class, which has
the following properties. All of these except for id may be set by an
application. See the page for the <a href="../classes/cg/timer.htm"><code>timer</code></a> class or for the
individual properties for more detailed information.
</p><ul>
<li id="6">
<a href="../operators/cg/n/name.htm"><b>name</b></a>: an
arbitrary symbol that is used to find a timer (by calling <a href="../operators/cg/f/find-timer.htm"><b>find-timer</b></a>), or to
distinguish an individual timer during development and debugging.
</li>
<li id="7">
<a href="../operators/cg/a/active.htm"><b>active</b></a>: a boolean
value indicating whether a timer is currently running. An active timer
"fires" each time its 
<a href="../operators/cg/i/interval.htm"><b>interval</b></a> passes, while an inactive timer
does nothing. This property of a timer will be non-nil if <a href="../operators/cg/s/start-timer.htm"><b>start-timer</b></a> has been
called on the timer more recently than <a href="../operators/cg/s/stop-timer.htm"><b>stop-timer</b></a> has. If the active
property is explicitly modified by an application from nil to non-nil,
then start-timer is called internally, and if the active property is
explicitly modified from non-nil to nil, then stop-timer is called
internally. Therefore, in order to wrap all starting and stopping of
timers, it is sufficient to add <a href="../operators/cg/s/start-timer.htm"><b>start-timer</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/s/stop-timer.htm"><b>stop-timer</b></a> methods.
</li>
<li id="8">
<a href="../operators/cg/i/id.htm"><b>id</b></a>: a positive
integer that is assigned and used by the operating system to uniquely
identify a particular timer. Use of <a href="../operators/cg/i/id.htm"><b>id</b></a> is deprecated. An application
should never modify this property. Any given timer object will always
use the same id, and no other timer object will use that id.
</li>
<li id="9">
<a href="../operators/cg/i/interval.htm"><b>interval</b></a> a
positive integer indicating the number of milliseconds after a timer
is started that it will "fire" by calling the generic function <a href="../operators/cg/t/timer.htm"><b>timer</b></a>. The default timer
method calls the timer's individual <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-timer.htm"><b>on-timer</b></a> function (if it
has one), which is where timer messages are usually handled by an
application. If the interval property is modified while a timer is
active, then the timer is stopped and immediately restarted using the
new interval. The interval default-initarg for the timer class is
1000, which will fire the timer once a second.
</li>
<li id="10">
<a href="../operators/cg/o/on-timer.htm"><b>on-timer</b></a>:
the name of a function that is invoked after the timer's interval has
elapsed (assuming that the default 
<a href="../operators/cg/t/timer.htm"><b>timer</b></a> method has not been
overridden). The function should take a single argument, which is the
timer itself.  Its returned values are not used. The default value is
nil, and so a timer will not "do anything" unless it is given a custom
on-timer function (or a 
<a href="../operators/cg/t/timer.htm"><b>timer</b></a> method is added for it).
<p id="11">
An on-timer function may call <a href="../operators/cg/s/stop-timer.htm"><b>stop-timer</b></a> on the timer (or set the
timer's <a href="../operators/cg/a/active.htm"><b>active</b></a>
property to nil) if the on-timer function should be invoked only a
single time after the timer is started. Otherwise the on-timer
function will be called each time the timer's interval has elapsed
until <a href="../operators/cg/s/stop-timer.htm"><b>stop-timer</b></a>
is called on the timer (or its <a href="../operators/cg/a/active.htm"><b>active</b></a> property is set to nil).
</p>
</li>
<li id="12">
<a href="../operators/cg/t/timer-count.htm"><b>timer-count</b></a>: a
non-negative integer indicating the number of times that a timer's
interval has elapsed since it was most recently started. This value is
supplied for general information, and is not used internally by Common
Graphics. An application could modify this value if desired, though
there is probably no reason to do so.
<p id="13">
When a timer is started, this property is set to zero. Each time a
timer's interval has elapsed, the default <a href="../operators/cg/t/timer.htm"><b>timer</b></a> method increments the
timer's timer-count by one and then calls its <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-timer.htm"><b>on-timer</b></a> function. If a timer count
reaches 50 million, it is reset to zero to prevent the consing of
bignums.
</p>
</li>
<li id="14">
<a href="../operators/cg/t/timer-info.htm"><b>timer-info</b></a>: a
place for an application to store arbitrary information about its
current use of a timer. Typically, when an application starts a timer,
it will store an object here to which the timer's <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-timer.htm"><b>on-timer</b></a> function may (or
may not) apply its functionality when it is invoked. The value of this
property can be any Lisp object.
<p id="15">
(The <a href="../classes/cg/timer.htm"><code>timer</code></a>
class can of course be subclassed in order to add custom slots for
this or any other purpose, but this single timer-info slot is provided
since such a handy place is often needed due to the asynchronous
nature of timers, and a single slot is often sufficient.)
