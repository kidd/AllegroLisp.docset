The Chart Widget is a new feature in Allegro CL 8.1. This document
provides a tutorial on its use.
</p>
<p id="6">
There is a <a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a>
example in the IDE's <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator Dialog</a>. You may want to try
it first to get a feel for the variety of things that the chart-widget
can do.  Then return to this tutorial to learn how to write
chart-widget code from scratch. Once you have displayed the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator Dialog</a>
(using the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/help-menu.htm">Help
menu</a>), display the <b>Examples</b> tab and search for
<b>chart-widget</b> in the list of examples.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="7"><a name="initial-example-1">2.0 An initial complete chart-widget example</a></h2>

<p id="8">
Before beginning the actual tutorial, here is a complete example of
typical code for creating a <a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> and giving it some values.  This is
to give you an overview of the kind of code that is involved.
</p>
<p id="9">
Evaluate the following code and check out the chart that it creates.
Here's how you can evaluate the pieces of code throughout this
tutorial. If you are viewing this in the IDE's <b>Allegro Help</b>
window, then you can select each form by clicking down just to the
left of the opening parenthesis and then dragging just past the final
closing parenthesis and releasing. You can then use the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Tools | Incremental Evaluation</a>
command (control-E in Host mode) to evaluate the form in place.
Otherwise you could first copy each form to the editor and evaluate it
there. To evaluate the whole sequence of forms most quickly, open the
file <i>[Allegro directory]/examples/cg/chart-tutorial.cl</i>.  In
that file you can simply press the numeric keypad's Enter key multiple
times to evaluate successive forms and skip over the comment blocks.
(Alternately use the main Enter key while holding down the Alt key.)

This window should be displayed (but the values are chosen randomly so
the heights of the bars will be different):
</p>

<p id="12"><img src="../pictures/cw-tut-1.jpg"></p>

<p id="13">
That example specifies the values of various chart properties as
initargs to <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a>,
which is the typical way to do it. In the tutorial we will usually
specify property values by calling accessor functions instead, so you
can see them change one at a time.
</p>
<p id="14">
Notice in the code above how certain chart "sub-objects" such as the
item-axis are created first, and then the sub-objects are passed as
initargs to the chart-widget itself.  (If you don't specify a
particular sub-oject explicitly, a default one will be created
automatically.)
</p>
<p id="15">
After creating the chart-widget, <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a> is called a number of times to
add data values to the chart.
</p>
<p id="16">
After looking over that code a bit to get a general feel for it, you
can close the chart dialog and proceed with the tutorial, where we
will take things one step at a time.
</p>
<p id="17">
In the IDE, a chart-widget can alternately be created interactively by
using the chart-widget button on the Components Toolbar to place a
chart-widget onto a form window in a project.  The button shows two
vertical bar-chart bars, one red and one blue.  You can then modify
the properties in the inspector as with other widgets.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="18"><a name="tutorial-1">3.0 The chart-widget tutorial</a></h2>

<p id="19">
First we'll make an empty <a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> on a dialog, looking like this:
</p>

<p id="20"><img src="../pictures/cw-tut-2.jpg"></p>

<p id="21">
We'll reuse this
single chart-widget throughout the tutorial, and so we'll bind the
global variable <code>*chart-widget*</code> to the tutorial
widget to make it easy to modify it with top-level forms.  And since
we'll be changing the state of this single widget through the
tutorial, it's important to evaluate the tutorial code sequentially,
since some steps undo a state that was created in the previous step.
And don't close the "Chart Tutorial" window until the end.
</p>

<p id="23">
You may want to move and resize the tutorial dialog that you just
created so that it's beside this window where you're reading the
tutorial.  And you might want to watch the chart widget as you
evaluate each expression so that you notice each change to the widget.
</p>
<p id="24">
Remember not to close this <b>"Chart Tutorial"</b> dialog until you're
done with the tutorial.
</p>
<p id="25">
While the chart-widget has many properties for customizing its
appearance, you typically don't need to specify many of them because
they have reasonable default values.  Above we initially specified
only <code>:chart-view :bar</code> to display the data as a bar
chart.  (The default value is <code>:line</code>, which displays
the same data as a line graph instead.)  As usual with widget
properties, most any chart-widget property can be set up at creation
time with an initarg, as in <code>:chart-view :bar</code>, or
changed any time later by calling the associated property-setting
function, as in <code>(setf (chart-view *chart-widget*)
:bar)</code>.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="26"><a name="adding-data-2">3.1 Adding data to a chart-widget</a></h2>

<p id="27">
Without specifying any further properties, we can immediately begin
adding values to the chart and see what happens.  We do this by
calling the main <a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> function, which is <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a>.  Let's add an initial
value of 12.
</p>

<pre id="28">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :value 12)
</pre>

<p id="29">
Notice that the range of values on the vertical axis at the left
automatically became 0 to 15, with additional tic marks for 5 and 10.
The chart-widget by default will automatically choose "round"
(decimal) values for the value range so that it contains all of the
values that you've added so far.  (To override this computed range,
you could provide explicit values for the <a href="../operators/cg/r/range-bottom.htm"><b>range-bottom</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/r/range-top.htm"><b>range-top</b></a> properties.)
</p>
<p id="30">
Adding additional values will continue to use the same range as long
as the new values fit within it.
</p>

<pre id="31">
(progn
  (set-chart-value *chart-widget* :value 7)
  (set-chart-value *chart-widget* :value 14))
</pre>

<p id="32">
But adding a value outside the range will cause the range to be
expanded as needed.
</p>

<pre id="33">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :value 37)
</pre>

<p id="34">
And of course negative values are no problem.
</p>

<pre id="35">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :value -4)
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="36"><a name="chart-axes-2">3.2 Chart axes</a></h2>

<p id="37">
The vertical axis at the left is called the <b>value axis</b>.  It
always displays a continuous range of values between a minimum value
and a maximum.  The horizontal axis at the bottom, on the other hand,
is called the <b>item axis</b> because it always displays a sequence
of discrete items, which have values.
</p>
<p id="38">
The value axis does not have to be the vertical one; the axes can be
swapped by setting the <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-orientation.htm"><b>chart-orientation</b></a> property.  So it's best to
always speak of the value axis and the item axis rather the vertical
and horizontal axes.  And either axis can increase in the opposite
direction via the <a href="../operators/cg/i/invert-axis.htm"><b>invert-axis</b></a>
property.
</p>
<p id="39">
Let's give these axes some labels to identify them.  While we're at
it, let's add titles to the whole chart as well.  Normally you'd pass
the initargs for these properties when creating the widget, but we're
doing things one at a time here.
</p>

<pre id="40">
(progn
  (setf (axis-label (value-axis *chart-widget*)) "Value")
  (setf (axis-label (item-axis *chart-widget*)) "Item")
  (setf (title *chart-widget*) "Chart Tutorial")
  (setf (subtitle *chart-widget*)
    "Building a chart one step at a time."))
</pre>

<p id="41">
Notice how the body of the chart became smaller to make room for the
new labels.  The layout is another thing that the widget handles for
you automatically, though there are properties for overriding things
like the spacing between parts of the chart and the font sizes and so
on.
</p>
<p id="42">
Don't miss the special thing that we needed to do just now to modify a
property of the value axis:
</p>

<pre id="43">
(setf (axis-label (value-axis *chart-widget*)) "Value")
</pre>

<p id="44">
We first needed to call <a href="../operators/cg/v/value-axis.htm"><b>value-axis</b></a> to find the value axis sub-object of
the chart widget, and then call <code>(setf axis-label)</code>
on the value axis.  There are two reasons for this design:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="45">

It avoids redundant properties between the two kinds of axes, which
share almost all of the same properties.

</li>
<li id="46">

There are so many chart
properties that dealing with all of them on a single object would be
somewhat unwieldy.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="47">
The complete set of sub-objects is <a href="../operators/cg/i/item-axis.htm"><b>item-axis</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/v/value-axis.htm"><b>value-axis</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/b/bar-chart-view.htm"><b>bar-chart-view</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/l/line-graph-view.htm"><b>line-graph-view</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-legend.htm"><b>chart-legend</b></a>.  If you're editing a chart-widget
in the inspector, you will need to click on those sub-object names in
the left column to get to their properties.  That's not needed with
most widgets.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="48"><a name="modifying-items-2">3.3 Modifying existing chart items</a></h2>

<p id="49">
So far we've used <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a> only to add new bars to our bar
graph, but it's more versatile.  You can also change the value of
existing chart items at any time, for example.  The bar labeled "3"
looks a little too tall, so let's make it shorter by passing its index
along with a new value.
</p>

<pre id="50">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :item-index 3 :value 10)
</pre>

<p id="51">
You might notice that the value axis range could be made smaller now,
but that wasn't done automatically.  The value range is adjusted
automatically only when it needs to be larger for a few different
reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="52">

The smaller case is less of a problem since no values get
clipped off.

</li>
<li id="53">

Typically values don't all shrink by enough to make a
smaller range important.

</li>
<li id="54">

(This one especially) it would take much longer to detect the smaller
case because all values would need to be checked rather than just the
new one, and so it might noticeably slow down calls to <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a>.

</li>
</ol>

<p id="55">
But you can tell the chart to recompute the range at any time by
calling <a href="../operators/cg/u/update-chart-widget.htm"><b>update-chart-widget</b></a>.
</p>

<pre id="56">
(update-chart-widget *chart-widget*)
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="57"><a name="additional-values-2">3.4 Additional types of chart values</a></h2>

<p id="58">
The <i>value</i> argument specifies the principal value
for a chart-item, but there are additional types of values as well.
When showing the bar-chart view, the widget can also display a
<i>from-value</i> argument by making the bar begin at a
different place than the usual "base value".  Let's make the fourth
bar begin at a non-zero value.
</p>

<pre id="59">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :item-index 3 :from-value 3)
</pre>

<p id="60">
Other auxilliary value types include <i>high-value</i>,
<i>low-value</i>, and <i>icon-size</i>.
</p>

<pre id="61">
(set-chart-value *chart-widget* :item-index 1
                 :high-value 8 :low-value 4)
</pre>

<p id="62">
These values are drawn as T's by default, a style which is often used
to indicate error ranges.  But high and low values have a couple of
other drawing styles as well.  (The default is called
<code>:tee</code>.)
</p>

<pre id="63">
(setf (high-low-value-style (bar-chart-view *chart-widget*))
  :bar)

(setf (high-low-value-style (bar-chart-view *chart-widget*))
  :diamond)
</pre>

<p id="64">
Any values that you've added can be turned off by setting them to
<code>nil</code> instead of a number.  So let's turn those
high and low values back off (one at a time this time, to show that
they are independent).
</p>

A set of bars could be used as a set of meters by updating their
values repeatedly.  Here's a quick example of modifying bars randomly.
This example passes the <i>update-now</i> argument to
redisplay the chart after every change for an animation effect, rather
than letting them all get queued for a single redisplay at the end, as
would normally happen.  It also calls <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-value.htm"><b>chart-value</b></a> to read an existing value in order
to modify it incrementatlly.

<p id="70">
The <i>item-index</i> argument to <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a> can be any non-negative integer
to either add a new item or modify an existing one.  It can also be
the keyword <code>:new</code> to add a new item just after all
existing items; that's the default behavior that we saw early on.
</p>
<p id="71">
<i>item-index</i> can also be the keyword
<code>:last</code>, to modify the chart item that is currently
the "last" one, meaning the one with the highest index.  This is
particularly useful when adding a series of values for multiple chart
"objects", which we'll learn about next.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="72"><a name="multiple-chart-objects-2">3.6 Multiple chart objects</a></h2>

<p id="73">
Our chart has several bars so far, but these bars all refer to a
single "chart object".  A chart object typically represents a
real-world thing of some sort, such as a bowler.  A chart object will
have a sequence of values that are displayed in multiple "chart items"
along the item axis, such as an average bowling score for each month.
The <a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> can
simultaneously display multiple objects by drawing multiple lines
across a line graph, or stacked bars or side-by-side bars in a bar
graph.
</p>
<p id="74">
Use the <i>object-index</i> argument to <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a> to specify the object
for the new value.  The default value is 0, so you don't need to pass
an object-index at all when there is only a single object in the
chart.

Let's fill in some values for multiple objects to see what that looks

We can similarly add meaningful month labels to the chart item tic

One way is to supply a printer function that converts directly from an
item's index to the string to display.  If we know that the values we
added began at January 2005, then our function can calculate the month
and year of each index, and format a string from those two values.

That was a little bit tricky writing an <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-print-major-label.htm"><b>on-print-major-label</b></a> function to convert item
indices to item label strings, because the item indices aren't very
meaningful.  Another approach is to give each chart item a meaningful
ID when the item is created.  Then the meaningful ID will be passed to
the printer function, which it can interpret more easily.  (The
default ID is the index.)
</p>
<p id="103">
This second approach would even be necessary if the items are not
regularly-spaced values with a simple mapping from their indices to
their meanings.  Let's say that our bowlers aren't in a league and
instead bowl occasionally whenever they get the urge.  Let's
furthermore pretend that they've already got a record of recent scores

We could use each date list like (2005 dec 12) as the ID of each chart

the current chart values and printer function, and add values from our
master <code>*scores*</code> list.

<p id="106">
This example also passes an object ID instead of an object index.  We
already set up the object ID's earlier when we set the <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-objects.htm"><b>chart-objects</b></a> property so that the

supply a <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-value-returner.htm"><b>chart-value-returner</b></a>

actually drawn (usually due to it being uncovered and/or scrolled into

calling <a href="../operators/cg/s/set-chart-value.htm"><b>set-chart-value</b></a>), the
item-index, the object-index, and the object-id.  Our

we'll look them up using that rather than the object-index.  Using a
<a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-value-returner.htm"><b>chart-value-returner</b></a> means
that we no longer have chart-items with item-id's, and therefore our
printer function will once again receive item indices, so we have to
replace our tic label printer function again with one that takes
indices.

<hr><h2 id="132"><a name="tics-2">3.15 Major and minor tic marks, tic labels, and grid lines</a></h2>

<p id="133">
The chart-widget and its sub-objects have many additional properties
that determine the final look of the chart.  Most of these should be
fairly obvious, or easy enough to figure out by playing with them in
the inspector.  One final matter that may not be so obvious, though,
is major and minor tic marks.  Both the value axis and the item axis
can have major tic marks, tic labels, and grid lines and/or minor ones
between successive major ones.  The value axis tends to pick out
"round" values for these properties for you, but you are likely to
want to set these yourself for the item axis where the widget can't
know what values would fit your arbitrary chart items.
</p>
<p id="134">
In particular, you may want to set the <a href="../operators/cg/m/minor-tics-per-major-tic.htm"><b>minor-tics-per-major-tic</b></a> property of the <a href="../classes/cg/item-axis.htm"><code>item-axis</code></a>.  This is always 1 by
default, and so all of the tics along the item axis are major ones.
If you happen to know that each of your items represent a quarter of a
year, then you may want to set <a href="../operators/cg/m/minor-tics-per-major-tic.htm"><b>minor-tics-per-major-tic</b></a> to 4 so that there will
be a major tic for each year, with three minor tics in between for
each quarter.
</p>
<p id="135">
Let's try that with our sine wave, where a <a href="../operators/cg/m/minor-tics-per-major-tic.htm"><b>minor-tics-per-major-tic</b></a> of 4 will place a major
tic at each 90-degree point. And by turning off minor labels, we will
cause the values to be closer together since they don't have to leave
room for all those minor labels.

<pre id="136">

Another way to save tic label space is to draw only every N'th label.

Here's how you can save the current image of the chart-widget as a BMP
file.  This works with any Common Graphics window other than an
<a href="../classes/cg/os-widget-window.htm"><code>os-widget-window</code></a>, though if
the <a href="../operators/cg/d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a> property
is not turned on then the window must be exposed at the time.  (A
<a href="../classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> always has
<a href="../operators/cg/d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a> turned on.)
</p>
<p id="144">
This example will save a chart as a BMP file and then show it in
whatever program is registered on your machine to display BMP files.
</p>

<pre id="145">
(let* ((pathname (merge-pathnames "chart.bmp"
                                  (sys:temporary-directory))))
  
  ;; Create a pixmap from the chart's window, and then write it to a
  ;; BMP file.
  (save-pixmap (get-pixmap (window *chart-widget*))
               pathname)
  
  ;; Show the saved pixmap in a third party program.
  (run-shell-command
   (windows-command-for-document-type "bmp" :path pathname)))
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="146"><a name="final-examples-2">3.18 Some final standalone examples</a></h2>

<p id="147">
We'll close the tutorial with a couple of standalone examples that
don't follow from the sequence above.  So feel free to close the
<b>Chart Tutorial</b> window at any time now.
</p>
<p id="148">
First an example similar to the one at the top.  This will illustrate
some of the finer points of major and minor tics and labels.
Specifically, we'll show monthly data with three months per minor tic
and four quarters per major tic, and offset the major tic labels so
that they are drawn in the middle of the years that they represent
rather than at the beginning of the years.
</p>
<p id="149">
We recommend that you study the various properties in this code to see
how they work together.

<hr><h2 id="151"><a name="using-two-value-axes-2">3.19 Using Two Value Axes</a></h2>

<p id="152">
And, finally, an example to show the option for two value axes.  Many
charts use two value axes with different ranges (and often different
units) to plot two lines close together to see how well they
correlate.  This can be done with the chart-widget by supplying a
chart-axis object for the <a href="../operators/cg/v/value-axis-2.htm"><b>value-axis-2</b></a> property, along with the usual one
for the <a href="../operators/cg/v/value-axis.htm"><b>value-axis</b></a> property.
The two axes work exactly the same way.
</p>
<p id="153">
The key value here is the <a href="../operators/cg/c/chart-objects.htm"><b>chart-objects</b></a> property, which specifies that the
:temperature value goes with the value-axis number 2.  (Any other
value means value axis number 1.)

So let's see how room temperature affects bowling performance.  This

lines go with each axis.  These include color matching as well as
textual notes in the axis labels and legend.
