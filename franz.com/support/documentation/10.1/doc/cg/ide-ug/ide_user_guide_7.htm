<p>A menu is a pull-down or pop-up list of commands. Because menus can contain any
(reasonable) number of commands and are displayed only by user action, they provide a
convenient way to group related commands in a way that they are available at any time to
users. </p>

<p>Only top-level windows can have a menu bar. A top-level window is a window that is
owned by the screen or another top-level window and is not a child window. </p>

<p>In the following illustration, the window has a menu bar with two menus: <strong>File</strong>
and <strong>Edit</strong>. Each menu can have zero or more menu-items. For the <strong>File</strong>
menu, there are 6 menu items. The horizontal line is a special type of menu-item called a
separator. The menus of a menu bar are of type pull-down-menu because as you click on the
title of the menu its menu items are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="menu1.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-1"></a>7.1 Some menu notation</h3>

<p>Menus contain <i>commands</i>. The object corresponding to a command is a <i>menu-item</i>.
However, we use <i>menu-item</i> when describing the programmatic aspects of menu but <i>command</i>
when discussing the appearance of menus in an application. There are special kinds of
menu-items, such as the separator in the illustration above.</p>

<p>A user can <i>point to</i> a command while the menu is visible. The command pointed to
is highlighted and if it names a submenu, the submenu is displayed.</p>

<p>You<i> click</i> a menu command not associated with a submenu to effect it (<i>choose</i>
can be used in place of click). When a command is clicked, the menu disappears and the
action associated with the command is performed. </p>

<p>In the title of a menu or menu item, you can define an <em>access key</em>. An access
key lets your user open the menu or access the menu item using the keyboard. If you wanted
to open the <strong>File</strong> menu in the illustration above, you would press ALT+F.
To invoke the <strong>Exit</strong> menu item, you would press &quot;x&quot;. Within a
particular menu, you should have each access key be as unique and mnemonic as possible.</p>

<p><em>Shortcut keys</em> are another way for your users to access your menu commands. A
shortcut key is (typically) a combination of a key like Control or Alt and a letter or
number. It runs a menu item immediately when pressed. In the illustration above, Control-O
is the shortcut key for the Open command on the File menu. You should assign shortcut keys
to frequently used commands. Windows reserves some shortcut keys for cross-application
commands like Cut, Copy and Paste.</p>

<p>A menu command may be associated with another menu (called a <em>submenu</em>).
Pointing to (putting the mouse over) the menu command causes the submenu to be displayed
and the user can point to or click on a command from the submenu just as with the main
menu. (Submenus allow very many commands to be presented rather conveniently since most
commands are not displayed at any one time.)</p>

<p>In this document, we specify a menu and command with the menu title followed by a
horizontal bar (|) followed by the command name, all in bold. Thus <b>File | Save</b> is
the Save command on the File menu. Commands from submenus are shown with additional |'s,
thus <b>View | Manage Windows | Iconize</b> is the Iconize command on the Manage Windows
submenu of the View menu. (We have been using this notation in other chapters of this
document.)</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-2"></a>7.2 Usual menu behavior</h3>

<p>Clicking or choosing a command causes some action. Menus are rarely used simply to
display information (although a command can cause an informative dialog to appear).
Information can be conveyed incidentally, however. The fact that a command is unavailable
(cannot be pointed to or chosen) can be informative. Some editors make the <strong>Save</strong>
command on the <strong>File</strong> menu unavailable if there are no changes to save and <strong>Paste</strong>
can be made unavailable when there is nothing on the clipboard.</p>

<p>A user can click on no command and cause the menu to disappear. Typically nothing
happens when no item is selected and the state of the program is typically the same as if
the menu had never been displayed. (We say <i>typically</i> twice in the last sentence
because the application programmer can associate any action &#150; displaying the menu or
pointing to a command or whatever &#150; with any effect. If you are programming a game,
you might have a Hint menu and cause the game player to lose points if the Hint menu is
looked at, whether or not a command is chosen. Or an application designed to study user
interfaces may record how often menus are displayed and items chosen as a way of learning
about user behavior, perhaps with an eye to improving the interface.)</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-3"></a>7.3 Pull-down and pop-up menus</h3>

<p>A pull-down menu is displayed on a menu bar. Menu bars are displayed only on a
top-level window. The menu bar is typically always visible and the user can display a menu
any time the mouse is available. </p>

<p>Pop-up menus are displayed by specific user action but have no specific location and no
title. Pressing or clicking the right mouse button in various locations in the Allegro CL
development environment displays a pop-up menu with context-related items. Another pop-up
menu is the symbol completion menu displayed by choosing <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/search-menu.htm#complete-symbol">Search | Complete
Symbol</a>. While typing in the Debug window or in an editor window. For example, at a
prompt in the Debug window, type </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>string&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and, leaving the cursor right after the <em>&gt;</em>, choose <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/search-menu.htm#complete-symbol">Search | Complete
Symbol</a>. A pop-up menu appears with items <code>string&gt;</code> and <code>string&gt;=</code>
(the two symbols whose names begin with <code>string&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><img SRC="Image54.jpg"></p>

<p>This chapter is concerned with pull-down menus. For information on pop-up menus, see
the online help topics <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-shortcut-menu.htm">pop-up-shortcut-menu</a>
and <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-lettered-menu.htm">pop-up-lettered-menu</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-4"></a>7.4 Menu bars</h3>

<p>To add a menubar to a form, select the form, and then either (1) click on <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#add-menu-bar">Form | Add Menu Bar</a> or
(2) select the menu property in the Inspector, and click on the Extended Editor button:</p>

<p><img SRC="form2-insp.jpg"></p>

<p>This displays the menu editor.</p>

<p>To have a pull-down menu on a window, you must: 

<ul>
  <li>Put a menu bar on the window. </li>
  <li>Decide on the menu title for each pull-down menu.</li>
  <li>Decide on command names. </li>
  <li>Arrange that choosing a command effects the desired action. </li>
  <li>Optionally make pointing to a command display a submenu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do all that and you will have a working menu. Here are some more things that you can
do: 

<ul>
  <li>Specify how to choose each pull-down menu using the Alt key. </li>
  <li>Specify a keyboard equivalent to a menu command (pressing specified keys has the same
    effect as choosing the menu command). This keyboard equivalent is called a <i>keyboard
    accelerator </i>and the menu-item accessor function for it is called the <i>event-synonym</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Make a menu command unavailable or available programmatically (unavailable means that
    the command cannot be selected or chosen and usually means that the appearance of the
    command is modified to indicate its unavailability). </li>
  <li>Adding command separator lines to menus (separating groups of commands). </li>
  <li>Checking and unchecking menu commands. </li>
  <li>Change the commands in a menu programmatically. </li>
  <li>Change the menus on the menu bar programmatically. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each one of these issues will be dealt with below. The basic tool for placing menu bars
on top-level windows and creating pull-down menus is the Menu Editor, which we describe
next.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-5"></a>7.5 The menu editor</h3>

<p>The menu editor looks like this:</p>

<p><img SRC="menu-ed.jpg"></p>

<p>You are given a default starter menu bar. You can make changes and accept the menu bar
by clicking on the OK button. As you work in the menu editor, you will see the menu bar
update on your form. If you click the Cancel button, the editor is closed and the menu
property is left unchanged (meaning no menu bar if it was nil before, the previous menubar
if there was one before). The starter menu bar has a File menu and an Edit menu containing
some Windows-standard commands.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-6"></a>7.6 Getting rid of a menu bar</h3>

<p>If a form has a menu bar and you decide you do not want one on that form, you can get
rid of it by clicking <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#remove-menu-bar">Form
| Remove Menu Bar</a> while the form is selected. You can also do it by selecting the
contents of the menu property when the form is being inspected and replacing those
contents with nil (by typing n i l).</p>

<p>The menubar will also not be displayed if you 

<ul>
  <li>click on the Delete All (<strong>x*</strong>) button on the menu editor toolbar. This
    makes the value of the menu property a null menu, effectively the same as <code>nil</code>.
  </li>
  <li>delete all commands listed by repeated clicking on the Delete (<strong>x</strong>)
    button on the toolbar until all commands are gone.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sec-7-7"></a>7.7 Specifying menu titles and shortcuts</h3>

<p>The menu titles, command names, and shortcuts are displayed in the Menu group in the
center of the menu editor. The display is an outline control, with leaves (terminal
entries with no subentries) corresponding to commands and nodes (entries with subentries)
corresponding to menus or submenus. The title of a menu appears in the menu bar or, if the
menu is a submenu, as an item in the parent menu. The title is not a command. Clicking on
it displays the menu whose title it is. </p>

<p>A shortcut is a key combination which when pressed has the same effect as choosing the
menu command. The shortcuts are shown in the second column. Menus do not have shortcuts,
only commands, shown as leaves in the display.</p>

<p><img SRC="Image57.jpg"></p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-8"></a>7.8 Access keys</h3>

<p>An access key in combination with the Alt key lets you display a menu and choose a
command from the keyboard. A tilde (~) is a non-displaying character in a menu title or
command name which marks the next character as the one to press when the Alt key is down
to display a menu or submenu (in a menu or submenu title) or choose a command. Thus, Alt-F
displays the File menu (whose title is ~File). Pressing Alt and keeping it down while
pressing F (displays the File menu) and N (chooses the New command) is the same as
choosing New from the File menu. The character after the tilde is underlined when the menu
is displayed. If no tilde appears, the command cannot be selected using Alt and other
keys. <b>Note</b>: because of an apparent Windows bug in some versions of Windows (but not
in WIndows 2000), access keys may not work when running a project with a form that has a
menubar but no other controls. If that happens, then to see access keys working, add any
control (e.g., a button) to the form. </p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-9"></a>7.9 Working with the menu pane</h3>

<p>The Menu group is the portion of the menu editor labeled Menu Name:</p>

<p><img SRC="Image58.jpg"></p>

<p>You cannot type in the Menu group. (You make changes that require typing &#150;
changing a title of a command name, adding or removing a tilde, etc. &#150; in the Menu
Item pane described below.) When a line is selected (as the ~File line is in the
illustration), its details are displayed in the Menu Item group described below and the
toolbar buttons will affect it as follows: 

<ul>
  <li>The Add button (with the +). Adds a new entry below the selected line and all its
    subitem lines, with the same indentation as the selected command. This new entry is named <i>Untitled</i>.
  </li>
  <li>The Delete button (with the x). Deletes the entry and all subentries if the entry is a
    node, not a leaf. </li>
  <li>The Delete All button (with x*). Removes all commands. This button is not specific to
    the selected entry. If chosen, all commands are removed and the menu bar is deleted from
    the form. </li>
  <li>The Move Up button (up arrow). Moves the entry up. It stays at the same level in the
    hierarchy. </li>
  <li>The Unindent button (left arrow). Removes one level of indentation from the entry. The
    entries below at the same level become subentries. Thus, if ~New is selected in the
    illustration (rather than ~File) and the left arrow is clicked, ~New becomes the title of
    a menu on the menu bar with entries ~Open, ~Save, etc. while the ~File menu has no
    entries. </li>
  <li>The Indent button (right arrow). Adds a level of indentation to the entry so it becomes
    a subentry of the entry above previously at the same level. All subentries are also
    indented. </li>
  <li>The Move Down button (down arrow). Moves the entry down among entries at the same level.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sec-7-10"></a>7.10 More on the menu editor toolbar and some anomalies</h3>

<p>If you add an entry (by clicking on the Add button -- with a +), the new entry has the
same indentation as the currently selected entry and becomes the selected entry.</p>

<p>If you delete all entries, the menu bar ceases to be visible but still exists. (Make
the menu property nil if you want no menubar.)</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-11"></a>7.11 The Menu Item group</h3>

<p>The Menu Item pane, at the bottom of the Menu Editor, allows you to specify the details
of the entries in the Menu group. The details of the selected entry in the Menu Pane are
displayed in the Menu Item pane and changes affect that entry only. Only one entry can be
selected at a time. Here is the Menu Item pane from the default menus (i.e. the File and
Edit menus displayed when the Menu Editor first appears) with the third (~Open) entry
selected:</p>

<p><img src="misect-menu-ed.jpg"></p>

<p>The elements of this pane are: 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>Item Name</b>: the value should name a symbol. This name can be used to find the
    menu-item programmatically. It is not necessary to provide a name. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Title</b>: a string (but do not type quotation marks when entering a title) which will
    be used as the label, of the menu on the menu bar if the entry is unindented, of a menu
    command if indented. The tilde (~) character is special: the tilde will not be displayed
    but the character immediately following the tilde will be underlined. When running a form,
    pressing Alt and that letter will display the menu if the entry names a menu or submenu
    (display as long as Alt is pressed) or choose the command. Thus in our example, pressing
    and holding Alt and then pressing F will display the File menu; then pressing O will
    choose the Open menu command. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a tilde displayed, enter two tildes. Thus, if the title is ~~Open, it will
display as ~Open and it cannot be chosen using the Alt key. 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>Value</b>: menu commands (such as Open) have values, menus (such as File) have on-click
    functions. Since Open is a command, this box is active and the On Click box is
    unavailable. So if a menu is the selected entry, this box would be unavailable and the On
    Click box would be active. Both Value and On Click are described below under the heading<b>
    How choosing a menu command causes something to happen</b>. </li>
  <b>
  <li>On Click</b>: see the description of Value just above. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Help string</b>: a string (but do not type quotation marks when entering text) which
    will be displayed in the status bar when the menu is displayed or the command is pointed
    to. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Synonym</b>: a synonym is a single key or combination of a modifier key (Control, Shift,
    and Alt) and a single key the pressing of which, while the window has focus, is equivalent
    to choosing the menu command. Only menu commands have synonyms. If the entry names a menu
    (as File does), this area of the Menu Item group is dimmed and unresponsive. To specify a
    synonym, choose a letter or another character (such as F9 or caps-lock) from the drop-down
    list and check which of the modifiers to the right (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) you want. You can
    require more than one modifier and you need not select any modifier, but if the window on
    which the menu is placed accepts text input, an unmodified letter key may make entering
    text tiresome. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Available</b>: the Available check box on the right allows you to specify whether the
    menu or menu command is initially available. An available menu can be displayed; an
    available menu command can be selected and chosen. Unavailable menus are dimmed on the
    menu bar; they cannot be displayed so pressing or clicking the mouse over the menu title
    has no effect. Unavailable menu items are dimmed in the menu, do not highlight when the
    cursor is over them, and cannot be chosen. We describe below how to change the
    availability of a menu or menu item programmatically when the application is running. It
    is common to make menu items (or menus) unavailable when the choice is not meaningful in
    the context or is not (for whatever reason) permitted to the user. Thus, when an open file
    does not need to be saved, <b>File | Save</b> may be unavailable. In a game, a choice may
    be unavailable because the user (player) does not have enough points to qualify for the
    choice. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Selected</b>: if a menu command is selected, a check mark appears next to the command in
    the menu. Communicating information by the presence or absence of a check, is the only
    &nbsp; effect of being selected. The user cannot by any standard action uncheck the item
    or remove the check. That is done programmatically and user actions can often trigger the
    programmatic change. Look at the <b>View</b> menu from the Allegro CL Development
    Environment. The <b>Toolbars</b> and <b>Status Bar</b> items are all checked (selected) if
    they are visible and unchecked if they are not. Clicking on <b>Toolbars</b> causes the
    toolbars (the standard and component toolbars on the Project Window) to appear or
    disappear (as they were invisible or visible) and for the <b>Toolbars</b> menu item to be
    programmatically selected or unselected. </li>
  <li><strong>Help-String Tooltips</strong> (available only when a menu rather than a
    menu-item is selected, and so is unavailable in the illustration): when checked,
    help-strings for menu-items on a menu are displayed as tooltips after the mouse cursor has
    been over an item for at least <a href="../../operators/cg/m/menu-tooltip-delay.htm">menu-tooltip-delay</a>
    milliseconds. See <a href="../../operators/cg/s/show-help-strings-as-tooltips.htm">show-help-strings-as-tooltips</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sec-7-12"></a>7.12 How choosing a menu command causes something to happen</h3>

<p>When you click on a menu command, the system knows what you have done: it knows which
window contained the menu bar, it knows which menu contained the command, and it knows
which command was chosen. But it doesn't know what to do with this information other than
pass it to the application owning the window, so that is what it does. In an Allegro CL
application, every menu has an on-click function. When a menu command is clicked, the menu
on-click function is called with three arguments: the menu object, the menu-item
corresponding to the command clicked on, and the window owning the menubar.</p>

<p>You can specify the menu on-click function in the On Click field of the menu-item
group. This field is only active when a menu or submenu (rather than a command) is
selected. </p>

<p>The default selection function for the default menus is <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item-with-window.htm">funcall-menu-item-with-window</a>.
This function examines the menu-item, extracts the menu-item value (which in this case is
a symbol naming a function of one argument, a window), and <b>funcall</b>s that function
with the window (owning the menu bar) as the argument.</p>

<p>It is common to have the menu-item value contain the information about what should be
done when the user clicks on a menu command. Menu-item values can be any Lisp object but
symbols naming functions are common choices. Since you define the function, you have great
flexibility about what it does. The menu on-click function is then just a function which
funcalls the menu-item value with whatever arguments you want, often no arguments or just
the owning window as an argument.</p>

<p>The menu-item value is specified in the menu-item group when a menu item is selected.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the predefined function <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item-with-window.htm">funcall-menu-item-with-window</a>.
Another useful predefined selection function is <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item.htm">funcall-menu-item</a>, which <b>funcall</b>s
the menu-item value with no arguments.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-13"></a>7.13 Some examples of getting menus to do something</h3>

<p>The function <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-message-dialog.htm">pop-up-message-dialog</a>
takes arguments <em>stream</em>, <em>title</em>, <em>text</em>, <em>icon</em>, <em>button-label</em>.
We are going to construct a menu whose command pops-up a message using that function where
the title and text say what command you chose. Now, of course, this is likely not very
useful in a real application but if you can get a menu command to pop-up a message like
this, you can probably get it to do many other things by emulation.</p>

<p>Our menu will be called Messages and have two commands: Hello and Goodbye. The menu
on-click function will be <a href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item.htm">funcall-menu-item</a>
and the menu-item-values will be the symbols <code>hello-function</code> and <code>goodbye-function</code>,
which are defined as follows:</p>

<pre>(defun hello-function ()
  (pop-up-message-dialog (screen *system*) &quot;Hello&quot; 
                         &quot;Clicked Hello Command!!!&quot; warning-icon &quot;OK&quot;))</pre>

<pre>(defun goodbye-function ()
 (pop-up-message-dialog (screen *system*) &quot;Goodbye&quot; 
                        &quot;Clicked Goodbye Command!!!&quot; warning-icon &quot;OK&quot;))</pre>

<p>We define these to the system (by, for example, evaluating them in the debug window). <code>(screen
*system*)</code> is the screen (meaning the dialog can pop-up anywhere), warning-icon is a
picture of a yellow triangle with an exclamation point, and OK is the label for the
button. Our menu editor after we have defined the new menu (and deleted the default File
and Edit menus) looks like this:</p>

<p><img SRC="ch7-me-hg.jpg"></p>

<p>Note that the On Click field when Messages is selected is <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item.htm">funcall-menu-item</a>. The On Click
field for Messages will only be available after you have added and indented the Hello and
Goodbye items, and when it is available, its value starts as <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item-with-window.htm">funcall-menu-item-with-window</a>.
You must edit that to be <a href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item.htm">funcall-menu-item</a>
for this example to work.</p>

<p>If we run the form and click on the Hello command in the Messages menu, we see:</p>

<p><img SRC="Image61.jpg"></p>

<p>If we click on Goodbye, we see:</p>

<p><img SRC="Image62.jpg"></p>

<p>There is not in this example much information in the menu-items. We could define a
selection function that extracts information from the menu-item but processes it itself
rather than having the menu-item value do the work. This can be useful when you define
menu commands on the fly, based on runtime information. In this case, the menu-item values
are strings &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;. The menu-selection function is the
following:</p>

<pre>(defun my-menu-on-click-function 
    (menu menu-item window)
  (declare (ignore menu window))
  (let ((title (value menu-item))
        (message (concatenate 'string 
                   &quot;You clicked &quot; 
                   (value menu-item)
                   &quot;!!!!&quot;)))
    (pop-up-message-dialog 
     (screen *system*) 
     title message warning-icon &quot;OK&quot;))) </pre>

<p>The behavior is the same as before.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-14"></a>7.14 Changing a menu or command (menu-item) programmatically</h3>

<p>Commands are what appear on menus. On our example menus, the commands are Hello and
Goodbye. However, the programmatic object associated with a command is a menu-item, which
is an instance of class menu-item and has various properties. One is the <i>available</i>
property. If mi-var is a variable whose value is a menu item,</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>(available mi-var)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>returns true or false as the menu-item is or is not available. You can use <b>setf</b>
with <a href="../../operators/cg/a/available.htm">available</a> to change (or set) the
availability of a menu-item. Evaluating the following makes the menu-item mi-var
unavailable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>(setf (available mi-var) nil)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the only issue is how to find a menu-item programatically. There are various ways
to do this, but one of the easiest is to give the object a name and get it using
find-named-object and that name. Here is the menu editor again with our Messages menu. We
have given the Hello menu-item the name <code>:hello-item</code> (illustrated) and the
Goodbye menu-item the name <code>:goodbye-item</code> (not shown):</p>

<p><img SRC="ch7-me-hi.jpg"></p>

<p>Now let us get a handle on the the form or window. When developing, click on <strong>Get
Component</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and then click on the form (or
window, if you are running the form) and then in the debug window, enter</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>(setq mywin *)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Programmatically, you can use <a href="../../operators/cg/f/find-window.htm">find-window</a>.
</p>

<p>Now that mywin is the window with the Messages menu,</p>

<pre>(find-named-object :hello-item mywin)</pre>

<p>will return the Hello menu-item,</p>

<pre>(available (find-named-object :hello-item mywin))</pre>

<p>returns true or false as the Hello item is or is not available, and</p>

<pre>(setf (available 
       (find-named-object :hello-item mywin)) 
  nil)</pre>

<p>makes it unavailable. </p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-15"></a>7.15 Doing something just before a menu is displayed</h3>

<p>The system calls <a href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a>
with arguments the window and the menu when user action should cause a menu to appear
(user action being, e.g., clicking on the menu title on a menu bar or pressing Alt and the
underlined letter of the menu title). <a
href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a> is a generic
function. You can write a before method that will run before the system call to the
function (making items unavailable, registering the fact that the menu was looked at, or
whatever). If you do this, it is best to make your own class of windows and specialize the
method on that class. This avoids paying the overhead every time any menu is displayed
anywhere within Allegro CL or your application.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-16"></a>7.16 Menu Classes</h3>

<p>There are several classes related to menus. The following is a class diagram showing
the menu classes. </p>

<pre>window
   ^
   |-- basic-pane
   |
   |-- menu
         ^
         |-- windows-menu
                 ^
                 |---------- menu-bar
                 |
                 |---------- pop-up-menu
                                ^
                                |
                                |----- pull-down-menu
                                |
                                |----- shortcut-menu
                                |
                                |----- builder-menu</pre>

<pre>Key: ^ = &quot;is a subclass of&quot;, reading up.</pre>

<p>Notice that all menus inherit from <a href="../../classes/cg/window.htm">window</a>.
That is a very primitive window class that provides a handle to an OS window object. The <a
href="../../classes/cg/menu-item.htm">menu-item</a> class is not shown because it does not
inherit from menu because menu-items are not an OS visible object. Instead, menu-items
inherit from standard-object.</p>

<p>There are several different functions related to creating an instance of a menu; the
table shows which function should be used for each menu class. <a
href="../../classes/cg/menu-item.htm">menu-item</a> is created with <strong>make-instance</strong>.
A <a href="../../classes/cg/menu-bar.htm">menu-bar</a> is created with <a
href="../../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm">make-window</a>. A <a
href="../../classes/cg/pop-up-menu.htm">pop-up-menu</a>, a <a
href="../../classes/cg/pull-down-menu.htm">pull-down-menu</a>, and a <a
href="../../classes/cg/shortcut-menu.htm">shorcut-menu</a> are all created with <a
href="../../operators/cg/o/open-menu.htm">open-menu</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-17"></a>7.17 Creating and modifying menus at run time</h3>

<p>Code similar to the following is generated if you accept the default menu bar that is
created when you open the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>. It provides the value of the <em>menu</em>
keyword argument to <a href="../../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm">make-window</a>. If you
want to see the code for yourself, then toggle the menu property on a form without a menu
bar to <font face="Courier New">on</font>. In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, click on <strong>OK</strong>
to accept the default menu bar. With the focus on the form, save it using the <strong>File
| Save</strong> command. In the editor, open the <strong>.bil</strong> file and search for
<em>open-menu</em>. </p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-18"></a>7.18 Menu tutorial</h3>

<p>This short tutorial demonstrates creating and customizing an application's menu bar.
The sample application is a mini-text editor that extends the default menu bar. <font
FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Sans Serif" size="3"></p>

<h4>Setup</font> </h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new project using <strong>File | New Project</strong>. </li>
  <li>If there is no form by default, add a form with <strong>File | New Form</strong>.</li>
  <li>Inspect the new form by double-clicking on it.</li>
  <li>In the form inspector, change its name to :menu-example, title to &quot;Menu
    Example&quot;, and status-bar to t. </li>
  <li>View the <strong>Project Manager</strong>, using <strong>View | Project Manager</strong>
    if necessary. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Project Manager</strong>, change the name of the project to :menu-example
    by clicking on the Options tab and entering :menu-example for the name. Press the tab key
    and notice that the title in the top Project window (the Allegro CL window with the menus
    and component toolbar) changes to &quot;Menu-example&quot;. </li>
  <li>Because you are creating a new text application, you will need to have your own window
    class with its unique behavior. Later, it will be necessary to add methods customized on
    your window class. The class property of a form determines the type of running window that
    is created. Before you can change the device to your window's class, you have to define a
    new window class. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Project Manager</strong>, view the source code for the menu-example form.
    You do this by clicking on the General tab and selecting the menu-example module and press
    the View Selected Code button (the second one with binoculars in the icon). </li>
  <li>In the menu-example editor, add the following class definition. Since we want our
    application to behave as a text editor we inherit from text-edit-window. In future steps,
    we will customize methods on our new window class.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <ul>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defclass my-window (text-edit-window)
    ())</pre>
    </font>
  </ul>
</dir>

<ol start="10">
  <li>The <a href="../../classes/cg/text-edit-window.htm">text-edit-window</a> class is
    derived from <a href="../../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm">frame-with-single-child</a>.
    Therefore, creating an instance of my-window also creates an instance of a pane. For some
    of the commands, it is necessary to add methods specialized on the pane of <font
    face="Courier New"><strong>my-window</strong></font>. Therefore, you need to specify a
    custom pane class for my-window. In the <strong>menu-example</strong> editor, add the
    following class and method definitions.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defclass my-pane (text-edit-pane)
    ())

(defmethod default-pane-class ((window my-window))
    'my-pane)</font></pre>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="11">
  <li>You need to compile the new window class definitions so they are known. Because you have
    added several new definitions, it is easier to let the <strong>Project Manager</strong> do
    the compiling for you. First, save all your changes by clicking on <strong>File | Save All</strong>.
    If you chose a directory for the new project, the files will be saved there. Otherwise
    save to a convenient directory.</li>
  <li>Then, compile the project using <strong>Tools | Compile Project</strong>. </li>
  <li>In the form inspector, change the class to my-window. Whenever you run the form, an
    instance of my-window is created. </li>
  <li>Save your changes using <strong>File | Save All</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Adding a Menu Bar</h4>

<ol start="15">
  <li>Add a menu bar to your form. In the form inspector, select the <font face="Courier New">menu</font>
    property and click on the extended editor button (the one with three dots). Notice that
    the <strong>Menu </strong>Editor is displayed and the default menu bar is added to your
    form. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, click on the <strong>File</strong> menu item.
    Notice that it has an <a href="../../operators/cg/o/on-click.htm">on-click</a> function
    named <a href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item-with-window.htm">funcall-menu-item-with-window</a>.
    This is the default <a href="../../operators/cg/o/on-click.htm">on-click</a> function for
    menus and applicable for most cases. Later in this tutorial (under the heading <strong>On-click
    event handler</strong>) we will show you how to use a different <a
    href="../../operators/cg/o/on-click.htm">on-click</a> function. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, click on the <strong>File | New</strong> menu item.
    Notice that it has a value, which is a function name, and that it does not have an <font
    face="Courier New"><strong>on-click</strong></font> function. Also, notice that there is a
    help string assigned to the menu item. In the next step, we will display this help string
    in the status bar of our form. </li>
  <li>Accept the default menu bar by clicking on the <strong>OK</strong> button in the <strong>Menu
    Editor</strong>. Notice that the menu bar remains on your form and that you can preview
    the menu by selecting menu items. </li>
  <li>Run your project and try the menu bar using <strong>Run | Run Project</strong>. Try
    selecting menu items and notice the help strings displayed in the status bar. Try
    selecting commands on the <strong>File</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> menus. In future
    steps, we will customize the behavior so that your text editor behaves better. When you
    are satisfied, stop the project using <strong>Run | Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Implementing Menu Commands</h4>

<ol start="20">
  <li>In the previous step, you may have tried the <strong>File | New</strong> and <strong>File
    | Open</strong> commands. By default, these commands created new editor windows similar to
    a multi-document interface (MDI) style. For our simple example, we want a single document
    interface (SDI) style similar to Notepad's behavior. In Notepad, you can only edit a
    single file at a time. </li>
  <li>First, let's fix the behavior of the <strong>File | New</strong> command. When <strong>File
    | New</strong> command is selected, the function, <font face="Courier New"><strong>new-text-editor</strong></font>
    is called. You can determine what function is called by using the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>.
    Inspect the <strong>menu-example</strong> form. In the inspector, select the menu property
    and click on the extended editor button. In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, select the <strong>File
    | New</strong> menu item. Notice that its value is <font face="Courier New"><strong>new-text-editor</strong></font>.
    <br>
    Click <strong>Cancel</strong> on the <strong>Menu Editor</strong> when satisfied.</li>
  <li>To add the new method for <a href="../../operators/cg/n/new-text-editor.htm">new-text-editor</a>,
    display the source code for the <font face="Courier New">menu-example</font> form. View
    the <strong>Project Manager</strong> using <strong>View | Project Manager</strong>. In the
    project manager, select the menu-example module on the General tab and press the View
    Selected Code button. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>menu-exampl</strong>e editor, add the following method. Notice that this
    method needs to be specialized on the pane rather than the window. This is because <a

</ol>

<h4>Customizing Showing Menus</h4>

<ol start="28">
  <li>In the previous step, you noticed that the <strong>Edit | Cut</strong> and <strong>Copy</strong>
    commands were available even if nothing was selected. For this section, we will customize
    the <a href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a> behavior
    for our window to provide better user feedback. </li>
  <li>In the menu-example editor, add the following method to <a
    href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a>. Notice that
    this method needs to specialize on the window rather than its pane. This <a
    href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a> method makes the
    <strong>Edit | Cut</strong> and <strong>Copy</strong> commands unavailable if there is no
    selected text. Also, the <strong>Edit | Paste</strong> command is made unavailable if
    nothing is on the clipboard. For all other menus, the default behavior is invoked by using
    <strong>call-next-method</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <pre>(defmethod about-to-show-menu ((window my-window) menu)
   (case (name menu)
     (:edit-menu

           (get-selection (frame-child window))
          (setf (available (find-named-object 'cut-command menu))
                (not (eq start end)))
          (setf (available (find-named-object 'copy-command menu))
                (not (eq start end)))
          (setf (available (find-named-object 'paste-command menu))
                (first (first *clipboard*)))))
     (t
       (call-next-method))))</pre>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="30">
  <li>Save all your changes using <strong>File | Save All</strong>. Try running your
    application using <strong>Run | Run Project</strong>. In the running window, try using the
    <strong>Edit</strong> commands with and without selected text. When you are satisfied,
    stop the application using <strong>Run | Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>On-Click event handler</h4>

<ol start="31">
  <li>Up to this point, you have not needed to define an on-click event handler for your
    menus. You have been using the default on-click event handler, which is <a
    href="../../operators/cg/f/funcall-menu-item-with-window.htm">funcall-menu-item-with-window</a>.
    We will extend our mini-text editor to allow users to select a different background color
    from a menu. For our example, we will allow the user to choose between system specified,
    red, green and blue. The background color menu will display a list of color names that the
    user can select. </li>
  <li>First, you need to add a Background menu to your menu bar. Inspect the menu-example
    form. In the form inspector, select the menu property and click on the extended editor
    button. In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, scroll down and select the Edit menu item.
    With the Edit item selected, press the Insert Item button (the big <strong>+</strong> in
    the upper left). Scroll down and notice that an Untitled menu has been added to the list. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, make sure that the new Untitled menu item is
    selected. Change its name to :background-menu and title to &quot;~Background&quot;. </li>
  <li>Let's add the system specified menu item to the Background menu. In the <strong>Menu
    Editor</strong>, make sure that Background menu is selected and press the Insert Item
    button. Select the new Untitled menu item and press the Indent button (right-pointing
    arrow). Change the name of the menu item to :system and title to &quot;~System&quot;. The
    value of the menu is deliberately left nil because a background-color of nil means use the
    system-specified color. </li>
  <li>Let's add a red background menu item. In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, select the
    System menu item and press the Insert Item button. Select the Untitled menu item and
    change its name to :red, title to &quot;~Red&quot; and value to red. The symbol, red, is
    bound to an rgb constant for red. Later, we will use the value of the menu item to specify
    the background color of the pane. </li>
  <li>Repeat the previous step for Blue and Green menu items. Set their values to blue and
    green, respectively. At this point, your background menu should have four items, System,
    Red, Green and Blue. </li>
  <li>Stylistically, it is better to have System separated from the other menu items because
    it behaves a little differently. In the <strong>Menu Editor</strong>, select the <strong>Background
    | System</strong> menu item and press the Insert Item button. Select the Untitled menu
    item and change the title to &quot;-&quot;. Setting the title to &quot;-&quot; is a
    special case that creates a menu separator for you. </li>
  <li>Finally, you should change the on-click event handler for the Background menu to
    background-color-on-click (which we define in 41 below). You cannot use the default
    on-click event handler because it tries to call the value of the menu item as a function.
    For this menu, the values of the menu items are the color for the background of the
    editor. </li>
  <li>Save your menu bar by clicking on the <strong>OK</strong> button in the <strong>Menu
    Editor</strong>. </li>
  <li>Next, you add a background-color-on-click function. View the <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    using <strong>View | Project Manager</strong>. In the <strong>Project Manager</strong>,
    select the General tab, select the menu-example module, and press the View Selected Code
    button. </li>
  <li>In the menu-example editor, add the following method. This method is invoked whenever
    the user clicks on a menu item in the Background menu. Notice that you have to change the
    background color of the frame-child (pane) rather than the editor window.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <pre>(defmethod background-color-on-click 
    (menu menu-item (window my-window))
   (declare (ignore menu))
   (setf (background-color (frame-child window)) 
         (value menu-item)))</pre>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="42">
  <li>Save all your changes using <strong>File | Save All</strong>. Try running your
    application using <strong>Run | Run Project</strong>. In the running window, try selecting
    different Background colors. Notice that the Background menu works but it would be nice to
    indicate what the current background color is by a check mark. When you are satisfied,
    stop the application using <strong>Run | Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Checking Menu Items</h4>

<ol start="43">
  <li>In the previous section, you noticed that it would be nice to check the current
    background color when the Background menu is displayed. This is very similar to setting
    the availability of the Edit menu commands before the Edit menu is shown. In fact, you
    need to extend the about-to-show-menu method for your window. </li>
  <li>Edit the about-to-show-menu method for my-window. View the <strong>Project Manager</strong>
    using <strong>View | Project Manager</strong>. In the <strong>Project Manager</strong>,
    select the General tab, select the menu-example module, and press the View Selected Code
    button. </li>
  <li>In the menu-example editor, change the <a
    href="../../operators/cg/a/about-to-show-menu.htm">about-to-show-menu</a> method to match
    the following. The selected property of a menu item indicates whether or not it is
    checked. There is a check for the menu separator item so that it will not appear checked
    and the system item is checked if the background color is nil.</li>
</ol>

<pre>
(defmethod about-to-show-menu ((window my-window) menu)

            (dolist (item (menu-items menu))
               (setf (selected item)
                     (and (null (string-equal (title item) &quot;-&quot;))
                          (or (and (null color) (null (value item)))
                              (if (and color (value item))
                                 (rgb-equal (symbol-value (value item)) 
                                            color))))))))
     (t
       (call-next-method))))</pre>

<ol start="46">
  <li>Save all your changes using <strong>File | Save All</strong>. Try running your
    application using <strong>Run | Run Project</strong>. In the running window, try selecting

    color. When you are satisfied, stop the application using <strong>Run | Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="sec-7-19"></a>7.19 Displaying Pop-up Menus</h3>

<p>Floating menus are implemented using pop-up-menus. A pop-up-menu is similar to a
pull-down-menu because it can have one or more menu items. The difference is that a pop-up
menu is not activated by clicking on the menu's title or by using the ALT key. Usually,
pop-up-menus are opened by using the right mouse click. You cannot use the <strong>Menu
Editor</strong> to specify pop-up-menus.</p>

<p>Pop-up menus that are opened using a mouse right click are called shortcut menus. If
you want to define a shortcut menu for your window, you do the following: 

<ol>
  <li>Define your own window class that inherits from one of Common Graphics window classes
    like dialog.</li>
  <li>Optionally, define your own shortcut menu class that inherits from shortcut-menu. Add a <a
    href="../../operators/cg/s/shortcut-menu-class.htm">shortcut-menu-class</a> method
    specialized on your window that returns the name of your shortcut menu class.</li>
  <li>Add a <a href="../../operators/cg/m/mouse-right-down.htm">mouse-right-down</a> method
    specialized on your window that calls <a
    href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-shortcut-menu.htm">pop-up-shortcut-menu</a>.</li>
  <li>Add a <a href="../../operators/cg/s/shortcut-commands.htm">shortcut-commands</a> method
    specialized on your window and on your shortcut menu class that returns a list of menu
    items for the shortcut menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a more general exported function called pop-up-menu. If you use pop-up-menu,
you are responsible for opening the menu, creating the menu items, and positioning the
pop-up menu.</p>

<p>The utility function called <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-lettered-menu.htm">pop-up-lettered-menu</a>
takes a list of strings and displays a <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-menu.htm">pop-up-menu</a>
with alphabetized accelerator keys. If the user clicks on an option, then the string of
the selected item is returned. Otherwise, <font face="Courier New">nil</font> is returned
if no item is selected. <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-lettered-menu.htm">pop-up-lettered-menu</a>
enables an end user to type a single key to select an item. It is used by the <strong>Search
| Complete Symbol</strong> command in the Integrated Development Environment.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-7-20"></a>7.20 Shortcut menu tutorial</h3>

<p>The following steps extend the previous mini-text editor example. For shortcut menus,
you cannot use the <strong>Menu Editor</strong> and will have to work programmatically. We
use the menu-example project created in section <a href="#sec-7-18">7.18</a> above.</p>

<h4>Shortcut Menu</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open the menu-example project using <strong>File | Open Project</strong>. </li>
  <li>First, let's define a new shortcut-menu class that is associated with my-window. View
    the <strong>Project Manager</strong> using <strong>View | Project Manager</strong>. In the
    <strong>Project Manager</strong>, select the General tab, select the menu-example module,
    and press the View Selected Code button. </li>
  <li>In the menu-example editor, add the class definition for your shortcut-menu.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defclass my-shortcut-menu (shortcut-menu)
    ())</pre>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Next, you need to associate your new shortcut-menu class with your pane class. You need
    to specialize for your pane rather than the window because the user will be clicking
    inside the pane not the window. Therefore, you need to add a shortcut-menu-class method
    specialized for my-pane to return my-shortcut-menu.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defmethod shortcut-menu-class ((window my-pane))
   'my-shortcut-menu)</pre>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="5">
  <li>Whenever the user presses the mouse right button, you want your shortcut menu to appear.
    By default, nothing happens when the user clicks the mouse right button in your window.
    Therefore, you need to add a mouse-right-down event method.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defmethod mouse-right-down ((window my-pane) buttons data)
   (declare (ignore buttons data))
   (pop-up-shortcut-menu window))</pre>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol start="6">
  <li>Finally, you must specify what commands you want on your shortcut menu. For this case,
    we have inspect and changing the background color.</li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, Teletype" size="3"><pre>(defmethod shortcut-commands ((window my-pane) (menu my-shortcut-menu))
   (list (make-instance 'menu-item

           :title &quot;Inspect&quot;)
     menu-separator
     (make-instance 'menu-item

       :value 'blue-background-color-command
       :title &quot;Blue Background&quot;
       :selected (rgb-equal (background-color window) blue))))

(defmethod inspect-command ((window my-pane))
   (inspect window))

(defmethod system-background-color-command ((window my-pane))
   (setf (background-color window) nil))

(defmethod blue-background-color-command ((window my-pane))
   (setf (background-color window) blue))</pre>

<h3><a name="sec-7-21"></a>7.21 Pop-up menu</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want to use the more general <a
