<p>The Allegro CL Integrated Development Environment facilitates designing and creating a
user interface for your application. The form is the canvas for designing windows.
Typically, each project has one or more forms, one identified as the main form and the
others (if any) subsidiary forms. Each form corresponds to a window in the actual
application. The various windows you see in an application &#150; the primary window (the
closing of which ends the application), other windows and dialogs all start as forms in
the design process.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we describe how to: 

<ul>
  <li>Add forms to a project </li>
  <li>Place and customize components on a form </li>
  <li>Design dialogs </li>
  <li>Test forms and projects </li>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-1"></a>6.1 How to add forms to a project</h3>

<p>Allegro CL starts with one blank form as part of a default project. The General tab of
the project manager (displayed with <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#project-manager">View | Project Manager</a>)
shows all modules (a module may have one or more files associated with it) associated with
a project. Form modules have two or three associated files: one .cl (source) file, one
.bil file, and (if there are pixmaps associated with the form,) one .bml file. All have
the same name but different extensions. The Project Manager shows the form name and the
location of the form source (.cl) file if it is saved. </p>

<p>You can add a new, blank form to the current project by clicking <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New Form</a> (i.e. click <strong>New
Form</strong> on the <strong>File</strong> menu). You are asked what sort of window to
design with a dialog similar to:</p>

<p><img src="../../pictures/new-form1.jpg"></p>

<p>We describe the choices just below. It is often useful to subclass the classes
provided: then you can write methods specifc to the new window (and others of the same
subclass), methods that do not modify the behavior of existing windows. You can specify a
new subclass in the area to the right. This class will be created and the new form will
have it as the value of the class property (accessed by the <a
href="../../operators/cg/d/device.htm">device</a> generic function).</p>

<p>A common choice is <strong>dialog</strong>. The different choices are called <em>classes</em>
(or, in older documentation <em>devices</em>) and name classes of windows (as described in
the next section). Once you choose the class, a new (and unsaved) blank form is displayed,
named form<i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is an integer not already used (thus form2, form3, etc.)
This new form is automatically added to the current project and will appear at the end of
the modules listed in the <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog-general.htm">Project Manager
General</a> tab. </p>

<p>You can add an existing form to the current project by clicking on the <b>+</b> button
of the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager</a>
toolbar and identifying the form source (.cl) file to the Open dialog that is displayed.
(The .bil and, if there is one, .bml files must be in the same folder.)</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-2"></a>6.2 Form devices</h3>

<p>As said in the previous section, when you click <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New Form</a>, a dialog
like the following is displayed:</p>

<p><img src="../../pictures/new-form1.jpg"></p>

<p>The choices shown identify the class property of the form (meaning the class of the
application window created from the form). Note that the accessor of the class property is
<a href="../../operators/cg/d/device.htm">device</a> (since <em>class</em> is a Common
Lisp symbol and should not be overloaded with a function definition). If you define a new
class (by subclassing the appropriate window class), it will be displayed in the dialog as
well, as the following example shows. Define a subclass of <a
href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a> by entering <strong>my-dialog</strong> in
the type-in widget on the New Form dialog, or by evaluating a form like the following in a
listener:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>(defclass my-dialog (dialog) ())</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Click <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New Form</a>
and the class choices now include my-dialog (which we have selected):</p>

<p><img src="new-form-my-dialog.jpg"></p>

<p>As we said above, subclassing predefined classes of windows is highly recommended. You
can modify your subclasses &#150; changing the initial property values, redefining
methods, and so on &#150; without worrying about affecting anything else. Change an
existing class and many things may break.</p>

<p>
There are many initial device choices. Among the more important are  are <em>frame-window</em>, <em>non-refreshing-window</em>, <em>rich-edit-dialog</em>,
<em>dialog</em>, <em>text-edit-window</em>, <em>lisp-edit-window</em>,
and <em>bitmap-window</em>.  The usual choice, if you intend to add
components to the form, is <em>dialog</em>, because it is the choice
most suitable for components since it supports ALT-key shortcuts and
allows you to move keyboard focus among its controls with the TAB
key. We describe each type and follow the description with definitions
of some terms we use.

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/frame-window.htm">frame-window</a>. The most basic window
    class, having only a title bar and a border. The title bar allows title-bar features such
    as close and minimize boxes and the border allows resizing with the mouse). There are no
    sub-windows and no backing store (defined below).</li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm">non-refreshing-window</a>. The
    subclass of <a href="../../classes/cg/frame-window.htm">frame-window</a> which contains a
    sub-window called a pane. It too has no backing store. </li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/rich-edit-dialog.htm">rich-edit-dialog</a>. The subclass of <a
    href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a> which provides a rich-edit-pane for editing
    formatted text, along with associated tools such as a status-bar, a toolbar with a
    rich-edit-multipic set of buttons, a rich-edit-ruler, and a special menubar.</li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a>. Another subclass of <a
    href="../../classes/cg/frame-window.htm">frame-window</a>, without sub-windows. This type
    of window can have controls and behavior such as tabbing between controls and using Alt +
    another key as access keys is supported (see <b>Tabbing</b> and <b>Alt Key</b> below).
    Toolbars are a subclass of <a href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a> and can be
    added to any window to group controls along the top. Dialogs do not have a backing store.</li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/bitmap-window.htm">bitmap-window</a>. This window has a <a
    href="../../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm">bitmap-pane</a> with a backing store and so
    automatically remembers and redisplays whatever is drawn on it (though any window can be
    drawn on). </li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/text-edit-window.htm">text-edit-window</a>. This window has a <a
    href="../../classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm">text-edit-pane</a> suitable for editing text.
    By default, text-edit-panes keep track of all text information, so they scroll and
    redisplay properly. They are in fact OS rich edit controls. </li>
  <li><a href="../../classes/cg/lisp-edit-window.htm">lisp-edit-window</a>: a subclass of <a
    href="../../classes/cg/text-edit-window.htm">text-edit-window</a> with a <a
    href="../../classes/cg/lisp-edit-pane.htm">lisp-edit-pane</a> suitable for Lisp code:
    Features like correct indentation are supported.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Note on windows with subwindows</strong>. The classes that have subwindows (<a
href="../../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm">non-refreshing-window</a>, <a
href="../../classes/cg/bitmap-window.htm">bitmap-window</a>, and <a
href="../../classes/cg/text-edit-window.htm">text-edit-window</a>) instantiate a frame
window plus a pane window inside the frame (retrievable by calling <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/frame-child.htm">frame-child</a> on the frame). This is not
absolutely necessary since you could just draw in the frame-window by itself, but it comes
in handy when you want to add a toolbar or status-bar to the window. When added to the
frame, these special panes become siblings of the main pane so that the main pane will be
an independently scrolling area and the size of it is the actual available drawing size
and so on. </p>

<p>When you subclass a class of a window with a pane, you should subclass the pane class
as well and provide a <a href="../../operators/cg/d/default-pane-class.htm">default-pane-class</a>
method so the correct pane will be instantiated when the window is instantiated. Thus, if
you subclass text-edit-window, you must (1) subclass text-edit-pane as well and (2) make
your subclass of text-edit-pane the <a href="../../operators/cg/d/default-pane-class.htm">default-pane-class</a>
of your subclass of text-edit-window (by providing a <a
href="../../operators/cg/d/default-pane-class.htm">default-pane-class</a> method).</p>

<p>Here are definitions of some of the terms we just used: 

<dir>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Backing store</b>: a backing store is a copy of the contents of a window which is
    automatically displayed when any portion of the window is exposed after being hidden
    (covered by another window or because the window was shrunk). Only bitmap-windows have a
    backing store. (The text in text-edit-panes is redisplayed when the pane is exposed but by
    a means other than using a backing store.) Note that a backing store is expensive in its
    use of machine resources.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Pane</b>: when a window has a pane, it is actually two windows, a frame with the title
    and border (and perhaps other things) and the pane as a child window. The pane's advantage
    is that it is automatically resized when its parent is resized or when additional
    sub-windows, such as toolbars and status bars, are added to the parent. In a frame-window,
    adding a toolbar (with <a href="../../operators/cg/a/add-toolbar.htm">add-toolbar</a>)
    covers whatever was at the top and the toolbar can be scrolled out of sight. If a toolbar
    is added to a non-refreshing-window (or text-edit- or bitmap-windows), the pane is resized
    (so nothing is covered) and the toolbar is not scrolled. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Alt key</b>: the ability to use access keys (pressing Alt and the underlined letter in
    the title) to change the value of a control or press a button. Access keys for menus on a
    menubar is supported for all windows.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Tabbing</b>: the ability to move focus among controls with the tab key.</p>
  </blockquote>
</dir>

<p>Because of its ability to have visible components, <a
href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a> (or your own subclass of <a
href="../../classes/cg/dialog.htm">dialog</a>) is the standard choice for a window with
visible components. Components on other types of windows should be placed on a toolbar
added to the window. Add a toolbar by specifying the toolbar property to be true.</p>

<p>Some examples of window types in the Allegro CL environment: the Project Window in
Allegro CL (with the main menubar and toolbars) is a variety of frame-window; the debug
window is a variety of text-edit-window. If you see a window in the Allegro CL development
environment that you want to emulate, click <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm">Tools | Get Component</a> and then click
on the window of interest (clicking on the frame will get the parent window and the
interior will get the pane if there is one). A printed representation of the window object
is written to the debug window. Evaluating <code>(class-of *)</code> tells the class. You
can then look at the superclasses with <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#graph-superclasses">Tools | Graph
Superclasses</a> (select the class name without the trailing &gt; and click the menu
command). Note that you should not use the classes of Allegro CL windows. Instead, create
your own classes with similar superclasses.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-3"></a>6.3 Specifying the main form of a project</h3>

<p>
The window corresponding to the main form of a project has the feature
that closing that window (by, e.g. clicking on the close button in the
upper right) closes the application as well. Main forms are displayed
with a different icon than other form modules when you view the
General tab.
</p>

<p><img src="Image45.jpg"></p>

<p>Form1 is the main form. Its icon looks like it is moving while the icon for form2 looks
stable. </p>

<p>The options tab of the Project Manager window displays the forms associated with a
project (this is from the Interface Builder Tutorial project):</p>

<p><img src="../../pictures/pm-op.jpg"></p>

<p>
The main form is identified &#150; doodler in the illustration. The
other forms are displayed in the drop-down list. To select a different
form, display the list and select a different form. The Init
Function, in the default is make-&lt;main-form&gt; but the default
name is not listed. This function creates and displays the window
associated with the main form so if you use the default init function,
when your application is started, the window associated with the main
form is displayed and it is the only window displayed initially.
Other windows must be displayed programatically.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-4"></a>6.4 Form properties that affect appearance</h3>

<p>Forms are components and have properties. You can inspect the properties of a form by
selecting the form. The illustration shows the properties of a form:</p>

<p><img SRC="ch6-insp-f2.jpg" WIDTH="329" HEIGHT="639"></p>

<p>All the properties are described on their online manual pages. Here we just mention
two: 

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="../../operators/cg/b/border.htm">border</a></b>: if <code>:none</code>, then
    the corresponding window cannot be resized with the mouse and there are no close or
    minimize buttons. </li>
  <li><b><a href="../../operators/cg/t/title-bar.htm">title-bar</a></b>: if <code>nil</code>,
    no title bar displayed and (as a result) no close or minimize buttons. </li>
</ul>

<p>Form design is somewhat WYSIWYG (<strong>w</strong>hat <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>s</strong>ee<strong>
i</strong>s <strong>w</strong>hat <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>g</strong>et), i.e. it
looks quite like its associated window, but a form always has a title bar, an active close
box and minimize button, and a border, and are always resizable while the associated
window may not have those features. These features are provided for forms to make them
easy to design. Further, the attachment properties of the components on a form (how the
component moves or resizes when the parent window is resized, e.g. <a
href="../../operators/cg/r/right-attachment.htm">right-attachment</a> and <a
href="../../operators/cg/l/left-attachment.htm">left-attachment</a>) are mostly disabled.
Components keep constant distance from the top and left of the form and are never resized
as the form is resized even though that might not be their behavior (depending on their
attachment properties) when the window associated with the form is resized. Again, this is
a feature to assist in form design. </p>

<p>Run the form (click <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run
| Run Project</a> or <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run | Run
Form</a> to see how the associated window will behave in the application). <strong>Run
Project</strong> runs the project's init function (which in the default displays the main
form only). <strong>Run Form</strong> displays the selected form regardless of whether it
is the main form. Also <strong>Run Project</strong> runs the project in a separate thread
(so you see an item for it in the task bar) while <strong>Run Form</strong> runs the form
in the IDE GUI thread.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5"></a>6.5 Components and forms</h3>

<p>Much of the time spent designing the user interface to your application is spent
manipulating components in forms. <a href="ide_user_guide_5.htm">Chapter 5</a> on
components describes the type of components, which are suitable for what purposes, and how
the behavior of a component can be customized. Here we discuss issues relating to
positioning components on the form, associating separate components with each other and
tabbing between components, issues dealing with components on forms rather than individual
component behavior.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-1"></a>6.5.1 Placing a new component on a form</h3>

<p>Click on a component button on the component toolbar. The button stays pressed until
you add the component to a form. Then clicking and releasing on the form (at the location
you want the upper left corner of the bounding box of the component to appear) places the
component with default size at that location. Clicking without releasing and dragging the
mouse positions the component with one corner at the click location and the other corners
specified by the rubber band box that appears as you drag. This allows components to be
sized when placed if desired. (Components can be resized at any time by selecting and then
dragging over the sizing handles that surround a selected component.) The new component
object will have default properties. </p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-2"></a>6.5.2 Placing a copy of an existing component on a form</h3>

<p>Selecting an existing component, clicking <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#copy">Edit | Copy</a>, and then <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#paste">Edit | Paste</a> causes a new
instance of the selected component (with all properties except name identical) to be
placed on the form. The new copy is placed close (offset down and to the right) to the
existing one (assuming they are on the same form). Move it to the desired location using
the mouse.</p>

<p>Note that copying works between forms as well: if you copy a component from form1 and
then select form2, clicking <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#paste">Edit
| Paste</a> will place the copy on form2. Using the same component instance (rather than
copies) more than once is not supported.</p>

<p><a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm">Edit | Cut</a> deletes the
component and puts the component object on the clipboard. <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#paste">Edit | Paste</a> places it on the
selected form. Selecting a component and pressing the Delete key deletes the component.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-3"></a>6.5.3 Positioning and sizing a component on a form</h3>

<p>When a component on a form has focus, sizing handles appear around it: If sizing
handles are solid, then you can use a handle to resize the component.</p>

<p><img SRC="Image47.jpg" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="275"></p>

<p>As the cursor moves over the sizing handles, it changes to a vertical (top and bottom
handles), horizontal (right and left handles), or 45 degrees (corner handles)
double-headed arrow. Pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse resizes in the
direction of the arrows. You can also change the appropriate property (height, e.g.) of
the component in the Inspector window while the component has focus and the size or
location of the component on the form changes. Also, pressing the left button while inside
the sizing handles and moving the mouse moves the component.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-4"></a>6.5.4 Aligning components</h3>

<p>As a component moves into alignment (vertical or horizontal) with another component on
a form, an alignment cue appears exactly when the components are aligned. Movement is also
temporarily stopped. If you release the mouse button while the alignment cue is visible,
the components will be in exact alignment. Thus it is easy to align components exactly as
you wish.</p>

<p>Clicking <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#show-alignment">Form | Show
Alignment</a> shows all alignment cues for currently aligned components. </p>

<p>Clicking <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#space-equally">Form | Space
Equally</a> while three or more components are selected repositions them so they are
spaced equally along the obvious (to the system) axis. This feature is most useful when
the selected components are aligned horizontally or vertically.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-5"></a>6.5.5 Selecting more than one component</h3>

<p>If you select a component (by clicking over it) and then, while pressing the Shift key,
click over a second component, both components will be selected. (And additional
components can be added to the selection in the same way &#150; press the shift key and
click over the component you want added to the selection.) Resizing is disabled when more
than one component is selected but all selected components will move as a unit if the left
button is depressed over a selected component and the mouse is moved. </p>

<p>You can select multiple components with rectangular selection. Click on the form but
outside of a component, drag the mouse and a selection rectangle appears. Any component
that overlaps or is enclosed by the selection rectangle will be selected when the mouse
button is released.</p>

<p>When more than one component is selected, the Inspector window shows common properties
and events shared by all the selected components. (The title of the Inspector changes to
Inspect Multiple. The values for the properties and events are for the last selected
component. Changing a property/event changes all selected components.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-5-6"></a>6.5.6 Component position when a form is resized</h3>

<p>Attachments are not active during design, because during design you need to specify the
form size and component location without one affecting the other.</p>

<p>When a form is resized, the top-left corner of the component maintains the same
relative position to the top-left corner of the form&#146;s interior. Component position
on a form is determined by the top and left properties (they specify the distance from the
top and left edge of the form). While a form is being designed, those values are not
affected if the form is resized. Therefore, if the top of a component is 100 (meaning it
is 100 pixels below the top of the form) and the form is resized so it is only 50 pixels
high, the component will <i>no longer be visible</i>.</p>

<p>Note that this behavior is different from what happens when the window associated with
the form is resized. The issue of what should happen to a component when the parent window
is resized is complicated: should it be resized proportionally or remain the same size? If
it remains the same size, should its location in the resized window be absolutely the same
(still 100 pixels down from the top and 30 pixels right of the left border, say) or should
they scale in proportion to the resizing (to 50 pixels down if the window height is
halved). The behavior is controlled by the various attachment properties &#150; <a
href="../../operators/cg/t/top-attachment.htm">top-</a>, <a
href="../../operators/cg/b/bottom-attachment.htm">bottom-</a>, <a
href="../../operators/cg/l/left-attachment.htm">left-</a>, and <a
href="../../operators/cg/r/right-attachment.htm">right-attachment</a>. We will not discuss
attachment in more detail here (see the online manual pages for attachment properties): we
are emphasizing that this is a situation where the behavior of the form and the associated
running window are different in that attachments are ignored on forms.</p>

<p>As a consequence, a large resize can cause a component to cease to be visible. This
form has three components:</p>

<p><img src="f-stmilcb-1-8.jpg" width="666" height="370"
alt="f-stmilcb-1-8.bmp (740054 bytes)"></p>

<p>When we make the height much smaller, the check-box and multi-item-list cease to be
visible:</p>

<p><img src="f-stmilcb-2-8.jpg" width="666" height="174"
alt="f-stmilcb-2-8.bmp (348054 bytes)"></p>

<p>They are still there of course. You can enlarge the form, move them up, and shrink it
again. You can also see the list of all components by clicking on the dialog-items
property (not the value but the property on the left). This causes the Inspector to
inspect the value of the <a href="../../operators/cg/d/dialog-items.htm">dialog-items</a>
property:</p>

<p><img SRC="Image96.gif" WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="205"></p>

<p>The first lines describe the value (identifying it as a cons &#150; i.e. a list) whose
elements are then listed &#150; the (still visible) static-text, the multi-item-list, and
the check-box. Clicking on 1 (on the left) inspects the value of our invisible
multi-item-list. </p>

<p>Modify the <a href="../../operators/cg/t/top.htm">top</a> property, from the current
232 to, say 10, and the multi-item-list is visible again:</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-6"></a>6.6 Setting component properties at runtime</h3>

<p>See <a href="ide_user_guide_5.htm">Chapter 5</a> for more discussion of component
properties and how to set them during the design (but briefly, select the component and
its properties and their current values are displayed in the Inspector; click on the value
of a property and either type in the new value or click on the button to the right of the
value slot to set using a dialog or toggle if true/false). However, you may not want to
specify everything at design time since you may want different things to appear depending
on information provided at startup or from the environment. For example, suppose you have
a window for providing information on how to contact you if your user has a problem with
the application. </p>

<p><img SRC="Image53.jpg" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="98"></p>

<p>This window may be part of a standard project used as a subproject for various
applications. The message may be the same for each application but the <a
href="../../operators/cg/t/title.htm">title</a> (foo as displayed) should be the name of
your application. If you are using this form for your Destructo application, your
Gardening application, and your Thai Cooking application, <em>Destructo</em>, <em>Gardening</em>,
and <strong>Thai Cooking</strong> should be the respective titles. Now, you can either
have three different forms, one for each application, or you can have one form whose title
property is set at runtime rather than design time. (And having one form means that only
one form has to be changed if, for example, you get a new telephone number.) </p>

<p>In the source code for your application, during initialization, an expression such as
the following should be executed (for the Destructo application, replace Destructo with
Thai Cooking or Gardening for the other applications):</p>

<pre>(setf (title (find-window :help-dialog)) &quot;Destructo&quot;)</pre>

<p>Here <code>:help-dialog</code> is the name (the value of the <a
href="../../operators/cg/n/name.htm">name</a> property) of the dialog, <a
href="../../operators/cg/f/find-window.htm">find-window</a> finds the dialog object (i.e.
the window associated with the form), <a href="../../operators/cg/t/title.htm">title</a>
accesses the title property, and <strong>setf</strong> is the Lisp operator which changes
values of properties. </p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-6-7"></a>6.7 Modal dialogs</h3>

<p>A dialog is modal if, when it is displayed, only it is receptive to events (mouse or
keyboard). Therefore the user must deal with the dialog before doing anything else with
the application. For example, the dialog displayed by <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#save-as">File | Save As</a> in Allegro CL
is modal. You must either specify a file as a location to save whatever is being saved or
click cancel. </p>

<p>For a dialog to be modal in an application, the following properties should be set as
indicated: 

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../operators/cg/c/child-p.htm"><b>child-p</b></a> property <em><strong>must</strong></em>
    be <code>nil</code>. If not, the window will not be displayed outside its owner and may in
    fact be hidden, meaning that it cannot be cleared, but neither can anything else be done.</li>
  <li><a href="../../operators/cg/m/maximize-button.htm"><b>maximize-button</b></a>, <a
    href="../../operators/cg/m/minimize-button.htm"><b>minimize-button</b></a>, and <a
    href="../../operators/cg/s/scrollbars.htm"><b>scrollbars</b></a> should be <code>nil</code>.
    Modal windows typically do not have these features.</li>
  <li><a href="../../operators/cg/s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a> should be <code>:shrunk</code>,
    so the window is not visible until popped-up with <a
    href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-modal-dialog</b></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up.htm"><b>pop-up</b></a> property acts as a
surrogate for those properties. If you set it to t in the inspector, the other properties
will be coerced to the values indicated. Note that the <a
href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up.htm">pop-up</a> property does not have additional
programmatic effect. Note too that a non-modal window can have the indicated values for
these properties as well.</p>

<p>Such dialogs can be displayed in a modal fashion with <a
href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm">pop-up-modal-dialog</a>. Every modal
dialog should have an obvious way for the user to deal with it since the user can do
nothing else until it is dealt with. The Default and Cancel button components are designed
for this purpose. Each has an initial <a href="../../operators/cg/o/on-change.htm">on-change</a>
handler function, <a href="../../operators/cg/r/return-t-from-pop-up-dialog.htm">return-t-from-pop-up-dialog</a>
and <a href="../../operators/cg/r/return-nil-from-pop-up-dialog.htm">return-nil-from-pop-up-dialog</a>
respectively, that closes the dialog and causes <a
href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm">pop-up-modal-dialog</a> to return t or
nil. After <a href="../../operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm">pop-up-modal-dialog</a>
returns, the dialog has disappeared from view but it still exists as an object and the
values of the components on the dialog can be examined. Options dialogs are often modal
(although the Allegro CL Options dialog is not). After the user has clicked the default
button (often titled OK or Accept), the program can act on the choices the user made with
code like:</p>

<pre>(if (pop-up-modal-dialog (find-dialog :options))
    (dolist (i (dialog-items (find-dialog :options))
               (... get the value and act appropriately ...)))</pre>
