<p>A <em>component</em> is an object used in developing the user
interface to your application. This broad definition includes forms
and things that can be put on forms. Informally, components are
things that can be placed on forms. Visible components that can be
placed on forms are called controls or widgets.
</p>

<p>Recall the steps in designing a window in your application's user interface are: 

<ol>
  <li>Creating a form </li>
  <li>Modifying the properties of a form </li>
  <li>Adding components to the form </li>
  <li>Modifying the properties of the components </li>
  <li>Adding event handlers to components on a form </li>
</ol>

<p>Creating a form is described in chapter 4 and chapter 6.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-1"></a>5.1 Adding a component to a form</h3>

<p>
When viewing a form window that is selected, first click in the
interior of the form to expose the Widget Palette. (Or use
the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#show-widget-palette">Form
| Show Widget Palette</a>.) Then click
on the button in the Widget Palette corresponding to the control of
interest. In the illustration, we have identified the Button and
Single-item-list controls: 
</p>

<p><img src="wp-but-sil.jpg"></p>

<p>Then click and release on the form to position the component with default size and
upper left corner where you click or click and drag on the form until the rubber band box
is the size you want. If you click and drag, the clicked on point is a corner but which
corner depends on the direction you drag. That places the component on the form. While the
component on the form is selected, the Inspector displays information about the component
and can be used to customize the component as you want. The component can also be resized
using the sizing handles around the component while it is selected. </p>

<p>Once a component is placed on a form being designed, it can be moved and resized using
the mouse. As it moves about, alignment cues appear between it and other components
allowing you to align it precisely with respect to other components on the form.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-2"></a>5.2 Component overhead</h3>

<p>Because every control (visible component) has an associated window, controls are
expensive to use in terms of memory usage and speed. To the extent possible, programmers
should minimize the number of controls that they use. For example, if you want to create a
toolbar, each button on the toolbar could be a picture button. Or, all the buttons could
be included in a single multi-picture button control. The latter method is preferred
because multi-picture buttons have one window rather than a window for each button.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-3"></a>5.3 The types of components</h3>

<p>Most components display something and accept input in some fashion. We have divided the
available components into several categories: </p>
<strong>

<p>Components that present choices</strong><b>. </b>The first two allow more than one
choice while the remaining three allow<b> </b>one selection only. 

<dir>

    displays one or more choices, any number of which can be selected.<br>
    <a href="../../classes/cg/single-item-list.htm"><strong>single-item-list</strong></a>:

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-4"></a>5.4 Component properties</h3>

<p>Each pre-defined component has many properties which determine the appearance and
behavior of the component. Certain properties are common to all components while others
are specific to components of specific types and others apply to one component only.
Properties may have the same name (and general purpose) but the specifics may differ
between different components. Thus, both the <a href="../../classes/cg/group-box.htm">group-box</a>
and the <a href="../../classes/cg/multi-item-list.htm">multi-item-list</a> have <a
href="../../operators/cg/b/border.htm">border</a> properties, but the possible values
differ and the range of possible appearances differ correspondingly.</p>

<p>When a component on a form being designed is selected, the Inspector window shows the
properties (on the left) and the current value of the property (on the right) for the
component. Here we show the properties of a multi-item-list:</p>

<p><img src="insp-mil.jpg" width="354" height="370" alt="insp-mil.jpg (21843 bytes)"></p>

<p>You can change the value of a property by clicking on the value field (unless the
property is read-only). The component on the form changes immediately when a property is
changed. If you are running a form, the running window is not affected by changes made to
components in its associated form. When files associated with a project are saved, the new
values specified to the inspector will be reflected in the newly saved source. When you
run a form or project, you are prompted to save all unsaved modifications, then the
project is compiled and loaded, and, when running the project, the init function is run
(the init function is not run when running the form). The default init function creates
and displays the window associated with the main form only. You cannot (conveniently) use
the inspector to change a property of a component in a running window. You must make the
change, and re-run the project. You can make the change while the project is running or
not..</p>

<p>Every component supplied with Allegro CL is described on its own page in the online
help system. (Every component is associated with a class and the class and the component
are described on the same page.) The online help is intended to provide the most
information about a component and how programmers can affect its behavior and appearance.
The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of component properties and to give
hints and pointers about what the issues are when working with components. </p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-5"></a>5.5 Programmatic considerations</h3>

<p>For most properties, the same symbol names the property and the function that accesses
and (if settable) with <strong>setf</strong> sets the property value. Thus the <a
href="../../operators/cg/n/name.htm">name</a> property is accessed by the <a
href="../../operators/cg/n/name.htm">name</a> function and set with <b>(setf name)</b>.
Most properties can be specified when a component is created programmatically (look at a <em>.bil</em>
file to see examples). The initarg for the property is usually the keyword with the same
name, thus <code>:name</code> for the name property, but not always. See the description
of <a href="../../operators/cg/i/initarg.htm">initarg</a> in online help.</p>

<p>Instances of components are created with <strong>cl:make-instance</strong>. To create a
<a href="../../classes/cg/multi-item-list.htm">multi-item-list</a>, you do</p>

<pre>(make-instance 'multi-item-list ...)</pre>

<p>Property initargs can be specified in the <strong>make-instance</strong> form. As we
said, to see code that creates a component and places it on a dialog, start a new project
(for testing), place the components of interest on the project's form, save the project
and look at <em>form</em>n<em>.bil</em> in whatever directory the project was saved. (form<em>n</em>
is the name of the form, form1, form2, etc. unless you specifically change the name).</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-6"></a>5.6 Properties common to most visible components</h3>

<p>Just because two components have properties with the same name, that does not mean that
the property behaves the same way or can have the same values &#150; we gave the example
of the <a href="../../operators/cg/b/border.htm">border</a> property for group-boxes and
multi-item-lists above. Here we provide a general discussion of properties common to many
components. The online documentation gives specific information on properties of
components. 

<ul>
  <b>
  <li>The <a href="../../operators/cg/n/name.htm">name</a> property</b>. All components are
    named by symbols (typically keywords). When a new component is created (a new form or a
    new component placed on a form) the name property is given the value
    :&lt;component-name&gt;&lt;unique-number&gt;. Thus the first form displayed when Allegro
    CL starts is named :form1. If a new form is opened, it will have name :form2. The first
    radio button used has the name :radio-button-1, the next :radio-button-2, and so on. These
    names can be used with functions such as <a href="../../operators/cg/f/find-sibling.htm">find-sibling</a>
    to get a programmatic handle on the object. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Size, placement, and attachment properties</b>. All visible components have widths and
    heights and are located somewhere on their parent (a window on the screen or in its parent
    window, a control in its parent window, etc.) The properties <a
    href="../../operators/cg/h/height.htm">height</a>, <a
    href="../../operators/cg/w/width.htm">width</a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/l/left.htm">left</a>,
    and <a href="../../operators/cg/t/top.htm">top</a> specify the dimensions and placement.
    The <a href="../../operators/cg/l/left.htm">left</a> and <a
    href="../../operators/cg/t/top.htm">top</a> are the location of the upper-left corner of
    the bounding box. The attachment properties: <a
    href="../../operators/cg/t/top-attachment.htm">top-attachment</a>, <a
    href="../../operators/cg/b/bottom-attachment.htm">bottom-attachment</a>, <a
    href="../../operators/cg/r/right-attachment.htm">right-attachment</a>, and <a
    href="../../operators/cg/l/left-attachment.htm">left-attachment</a> control how the
    position and size of a component are affected when the parent is resized. See the online
    help topics for left-, right-, top-, and bottom-attachment. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Appearance properties</b>. The <a href="../../operators/cg/b/background-color.htm">background</a>
    and <a href="../../operators/cg/f/foreground-color.htm">foreground</a> colors can be set
    in most (but not all) components. (The appearance of buttons is set by Windows and is not
    under program control. You can use a picture button if colors are important on a button.)
    Specifying t as a color means inherit the color from the parent. The <a
    href="../../operators/cg/b/border.htm">border</a> property specifies the border of the
    component and the font property specifies how text (if there is any on the component) will
    appear. The <a href="../../operators/cg/a/available.htm">available</a> property often
    affects appearance (unavailable components are often dimmed) but its main effect is
    programmatic. </li>
  <b>
  <li>Navigation properties</b>. Navigation refers to moving among or accessing components
    using the keyboard only. The two standard ways to do this are pressing tab to move focus
    among components and pressing Alt and a letter to select a specific component. When a
    window with controls is selected, pressing tab causes the focus to cycle among the
    controls whose tabstop property is true. The <a
    href="../../operators/cg/t/tab-position.htm">tab-position</a> property specifies the order
    of the movement. Clicking <a
    href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/form-menu.htm#set-tab-order">Form | Set Tab Order</a>
    displays a dialog that allows specifying tab order and tab order can also be set by the <a
    href="../../operators/cg/t/tab-position.htm">tab-position</a> property of the component.
    Note that <a href="../../classes/cg/multi-line-editable-text.htm">multiline-editable-text</a>
    components assume tab is a text input if the <a href="../../operators/cg/t/tabstop.htm">tabstop</a>
    property is turned off so pressing tab while a multiline-editable-text component has focus
    does not move to another component in that case. </li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <p>You can specify access keys for many components with a <a
  href="../../operators/cg/t/title.htm">title</a>, typically by putting a tilde (~) before
  the letter you want to be the access key in the value of the title property. The tilde
  does not print but causes the following letter to be underlined. Alt plus that letter, or
  just that letter can have effects similar to setting focus on the control with the mouse.</p>
</dir>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-7"></a>5.7 Positioning components</h3>

<p>While a form is being designed, clicking on a component selects it. An indication of
being selected is the sizing handles around the component. These allow the control to be
resized with the mouse. The component can also be moved with the mouse. As components are
moved, alignment cues appear as the component moves into alignment with other controls on
the form, allowing you to line components up precisely as you want.</p>

<p>Note that when you are designing a form, the attachment properties do not work. For
example, if a component has <a href="../../operators/cg/r/right-attachment.htm">right-attachment</a>
<code>:right</code>, expanding the window to the right (by placing the mouse over the
right side until a double-headed horizontal arrow cursor appears, clicking down and moving
the mouse &#150; all this is standard Windows behavior), the component should resize as
the window resizes. However, when you resize a form, the components on the form do not
resize regardless of the value of their attachment properties. This is intentional. On a
form, you should be able to size the form and all components as you want them to look when
the window first appears. If changing the size of the form changes component sizes as
well, the design process would be tedious.</p>

<h3><a NAME="sec-5-8"></a>5.8 Components that work together</h3>

<p>Some controls including scrollbars (<a
href="../../classes/cg/horizontal-scroll-bar.htm">horizontal-scroll-bar</a> and <a
href="../../classes/cg/vertical-scroll-bar.htm">vertical-scroll-bar</a>) and <a
href="../../classes/cg/up-down-control.htm">up-down-control</a>s are often associated with
another control, though most components that are scrollable have their own
(system-supplied) scrollbars, so scrollbar controls usually affect some attribute other
than positioning. An <a href="../../classes/cg/up-down-control.htm">up-down-control</a>
will automatically associate itself with an <a href="../../classes/cg/editable-text.htm">editable-text</a>
control placed next it on a form (the editable text control becomes the <a
href="../../operators/cg/b/buddy-widget.htm">buddy-widget</a> of the <a
href="../../classes/cg/up-down-control.htm">up-down-control</a>). Scrollbars, however,
never automatically associate themselves with another control. The program (that is you as
the programmer) has to use the <a href="../../operators/cg/o/on-change.htm">on-change</a>
event handler of the scrollbar to produce whatever effect you want when a scrollbar is
modified by a user.</p>

<p>The default range of an <a href="../../classes/cg/up-down-control.htm">up-down-control</a>
is (0 100). Change the value of the <a href="../../classes/cg/editable-text.htm">editable-text</a>
widget to (say) 1 by clicking on the extended editor button and entering 1 in the editor
window that appears. </p>

<p>Now run the form (by clicking on <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run Form</a> or <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run Project</a> in the <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm">Run</a> menu). You can change the value in
the <a href="../../classes/cg/editable-text.htm">editable-text</a> control by editing it
directly (as usual) but also by clicking on the up or down arrow in the <a
href="../../classes/cg/up-down-control.htm">up-down-control</a>.</p>
