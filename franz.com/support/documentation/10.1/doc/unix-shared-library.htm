Allegro CL supports the use of lisp via a shared library by C/C++
programs in the same manner as they use any other function
libraries. This document describes how Allegro Common Lisp developers
on UNIX machines can create applications with Lisp as a shared
library. See <a href="dll.htm">dll.htm</a> for information on creating
similar files on Windows.
</p>

<p id="5">
This functionality makes use of posix threads and is supported on all
Unix-style Allegro CL platforms.

<hr><hr><h2 id="6"><a name="why-update-1">1.0 Why an updated interface</a></h2>

<p id="7">
The previous Lisp as a shared library example was written at a time
when good thread library support was not available on many
platforms. As a result, the example was available on very few
platforms. Further, the example was built in a way that was not
compatible with how we build our lisp binaries, link in the allegro
shared library, and load in the lisp environment at startup. This
often led to problems in customer applications that were difficult to
debug. Lastly, many changes have gone into our lisp environment since
the example was written.  A refactoring of the Lisp as a shared
library interface allows us to provide a more simplified and concise
API.
</p>
<p id="8">
Many of the steps involved in loading the lisp environment need not be
exposed to the user, nor clutter their code. This updated interface
hopes to better separate lisp startup code from user application
code. A single call is needed to start lisp initialization. This call
handles choosing the appropriate allegro shared library, spawning a
thread, and returning control to the user once initialization is
complete. Various hooks, described below, allow you to perform app
specific initialization at various points, as well as synchronize
access to the Lisp control thread, from which calls into the lisp
environment can be made.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="9"><a name="lisp-app-files-1">2.0 Lisp as a shared library application files</a></h2>

The components of a Lisp as a shared library application are as follows:

<h3 id="20">
Foreign Code 
</h3>
<ul>
<li id="21">

User application code, including a user-defined main() routine. 

</li>
<li id="22">

lisp_ready_hook().  This function must be defined by the user with this name. It is the last routine called in the lisp thread during initialization of the lisp environment. This function hands off control of the lisp thread to the user-app and should be used to synchronize access to the lisp environment. 
</li>
<li id="23">

The lnkacl shared library (<b>liblnkacl</b>). This contains the
exported C API of the lisp as a shared library interface and must be
linked in with your application.

<h3 id="24">
Lisp code

<ul>

User application code.

lnkacl.fasl. This file should be included when building your
application image file. When loaded, this file
sets <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> in order to properly
set up the lisp side of the interface. Your application should instead
use the <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a> for initialization and
application startup code.

</li>
</ul>


<hr><hr><h2 id="27"><a name="lisp-init-1">4.0 What happens at Lisp as a shared library initialization</a></h2>


<p id="28">
The basic flow of control of a Lisp as a shared library application appears as follows:
</p>

<pre id="29">
<b>MAIN THREAD</b>

- user defined C main()
  - calls initialize_lisp(...)
    - spawns a new thread to load and initialize lisp
    - (wait for lisp_init_complete() signal)     
  - ...continue app execution... (see FOREIGN THREAD below)       

<b>LISP THREAD</b>

- lisp initialization begins, normal lisp startup sequence begins.
  - *restart-init-function* is called 
    (user:initialize-lisp, from lnkacl.fasl)

    - internal set up (such as define callback routine 
      lisp_lookup_address() )
    - call *restart-app-function*, a user defined function 
      to perform necessary lisp setup for user application.
    - call lisp_ready_hook()
      - signal init complete by calling lisp_init_complete()
      - user-defined code to handle requests to be handled by lisp
      - perform any application setup as necessary.
      - (wait for work)
      - call lisp routine. lisp_lookup_address() takes a string 
        as argument and returns a function pointer to the 
        associated lisp callback function.
      - pass return value(s) back to calling thread.
      - resume (wait for work) or return, which will terminate 
        the lisp thread.
   - exit_routine(int value)
     cleanup as necessary for shutting down lisp environment.

<b>FOREIGN THREAD</b> (MAIN or other)

    - contact lisp thread to request work be performed.
    - wait for (user-defined) synchronization event signifying
      completion of lisp work.
    - use value
    ... continue app execution ...
</pre>

<hr><hr><h2 id="30"><a name="for-fun-1">5.0 A note about using Foreign Functions on non-os-thread platforms</a></h2>

<p id="31">
On non-os-thread platforms, only a single thread (the thread spawned
by <b>initialize_lisp()</b>) can call into the lisp environment. As a
result, multi-threaded applications must synchronize with this thread
in order to dispatch work performed by lisp. This is done either from
within lisp in the application's <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> or via foreign code in
the <b>lisp_ready_hook()</b>).

multiprocessing</a>&gt;
in <a href="foreign-functions.htm">foreign-functions.htm</a>.

Synchronization with the lisp thread is left to the application
developer. A factorial example is provided which uses one possible
method.
