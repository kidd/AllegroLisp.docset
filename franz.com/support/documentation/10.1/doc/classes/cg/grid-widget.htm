<h3 id="3">
Class 
</h3>
<p id="4">
The class of all grid-widget controls.  
</p>
<h3 id="5">
Control
</h3>
<p id="6">
An instance of the <a href="grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> class. This is a very
versatile (and therefore relatively complex) widget that is useful for
implementing things such as spreadsheets and tables.  Grid cells can
either use built-in cell widgets or implement custom drawing and
mouse/keyboard behavior.
</p>
<p id="7">
A grid-widget may be divided into multiple sections, each of which may
be independently scrollable and resizable.  Within each section are
rows and columns that are collectively known as subsections.
(Sections are sometimes referred to as <b>main sections</b> to
distinguish them from subsections.)  Rows and columns may be
interactively resized, moved (to change their order), selected, and
deleted, whenever each of those options is enabled.  Rows and columns
may be added and removed programmatically at any time.  A row or
column can have its own individual stylistic properties, and can also
be replicated to produce a set of identical visual rows or columns
that are represented by a single row or column lisp object.
</p>
<p id="8">
Each section, row, and column is implemented as a <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/standar2.htm"><code>standard-object</code></a>.  A grid cell does not
have a Lisp object to represent it because the number of cells
increases quadratically as the rows and columns increase.  Instead, a
cell is accessed by methods that specialize on both the row and column
whose intersection defines the cell.
</p>
<h3 id="9">
Some illistrations
</h3>
<p id="10">
The <b>Examples</b> tab of the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator Dialog</a> has sevel Grid
widgets examples. We illustrate some here.
</p>
<p id="11">
Here is <b>Grid-widget: the simplest possible
grid-widget-example</b>. A simple grid. Left click on a cell and an X
is marked (as we have done with several). Right click and the X goes
away. Note the scroll bars. The widget is bigger than the window
displaying it.
</p>
<p id="12"><img src="../../pictures/grid-simple.jpg"></p>
<p id="13">
Here is a more complex example <b>Grid-widget: using built-in cell
widgets in ARBITRARY cells</b>.
</p>
<p id="14"><img src="../../pictures/grid-arb.jpg"></p>
<p id="15">
All these examples (and there are several more) are available to run
and the code the generates them can be examined and adapted or
reused. See the <b>Examples</b> tab of the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator Dialog</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="16">
Writing Grid-Widget Code
</h3>

<p id="17">
Using a grid-widget consists of constructing the grid-widget from
sections and subsections, specifying various stylistic properties, and
(the trickier part) writing methods that control how various grid
cells read application data to display, draw themselves based on that
data, respond to mouse clicks and keypresses, and finally write
user-modified data back to the application.
</p>

<h3 id="18">
Constructing a Grid-Widget
</h3>

<p id="19">
Normally you will first define subclasses of various grid classes so
that you can specialize methods on them.  The basic classes to
subclass are <a href="grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>, <a href="grid-row-section.htm"><code>grid-row-section</code></a>, <a href="grid-column-section.htm"><code>grid-column-section</code></a>,
<a href="grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a>, and
<a href="grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a>.
When you create a grid-widget instance, specify its <a href="../../operators/cg/r/row-sections.htm"><b>row-sections</b></a> property as a list of
instances of your <a href="grid-row-section.htm"><code>grid-row-section</code></a> subclasses, and
its <a href="../../operators/cg/c/column-sections.htm"><b>column-sections</b></a> property as a list
of your own <a href="grid-column-section.htm"><code>grid-column-section</code></a>s.  When making
each grid-row-section or grid-column-section, specify its <a href="../../operators/cg/s/subsections.htm"><b>subsections</b></a> property as a
list of instances of your <a href="grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a> or <a href="grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> subclasses
(respectively).
</p>
<p id="20">
Optionally, you can also specify the <a href="../../operators/cg/s/section-count.htm"><b>section-count</b></a> property of a row or
column to make that single row or column lisp object produce multiple
identical visual rows or columns, which are distinguished by an index
only.  Subsections can also be added and removed later by calling
<a href="../../operators/cg/a/add-row.htm"><b>add-row</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/a/add-column.htm"><b>add-column</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/d/delete-row.htm"><b>delete-row</b></a>, and <a href="../../operators/cg/d/delete-column.htm"><b>delete-column</b></a>.  Call
<a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> as
usual to create each object.
</p>
<p id="21">
Grid sections and subsections have various properties that determine
how they appear and behave mechanically.  These may be specified when
creating each object and/or changed anytime later.  Some of these
properties apply to both sections and subsections, including <a href="../../operators/cg/r/resizable.htm"><b>resizable</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/s/section-size.htm"><b>section-size</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/b/border-width.htm"><b>border-width</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/b/border-dashing.htm"><b>border-dashing</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/b/border-color.htm"><b>border-color</b></a>, and <a href="../../operators/cg/p/proportional.htm"><b>proportional</b></a>.  Properties
that apply only to sections include <a href="../../operators/cg/s/scrollbars.htm"><b>scrollbars</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/u/uniform-resizing.htm"><b>uniform-resizing</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/e/empty-color.htm"><b>empty-color</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/d/default-cell-3d-border.htm"><b>default-cell-3d-border</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/d/default-cell-border-color.htm"><b>default-cell-border-color</b></a>, and
<a href="../../operators/cg/d/default-cell-border-width.htm"><b>default-cell-border-width</b></a>.
Properties that apply only to subsections include <a href="../../operators/cg/m/movable.htm"><b>movable</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/d/deletable.htm"><b>deletable</b></a>, and <a href="../../operators/cg/s/selectable.htm"><b>selectable</b></a>.
</p>

<h3 id="22">
Manipulating Application Data in a Grid-Widget
</h3>

<p id="23">
In addition to writing code to constuct a grid-widget and specify its
mechanical behavior, you need to write methods that specify how it
displays application data and optionally modifies it.  (Further below
we discuss some higher-level alternatives that can remove the need to
write some or all of these methods.)  Here are the basic generic
functions to specialize in order to display data in a grid-widget:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="24">
<a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a>
fetches an application data value to be represented in a grid cell,
based on the <a href="grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a> and <a href="grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> that were passed to
it.
</li>
<li id="25">
<a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> draws
something in a grid cell, typically to represent a value that it
retrieved by calling <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a>.  <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> is called automatically
whenever a grid-cell is uncovered and therefore needs to be redrawn.
<p id="26">
If you know that an application value has changed and needs to be
redrawn in its grid cell, you still should not call <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> yourself; instead, you
should force the cell to redraw itself by calling <a href="../../operators/cg/i/invalidate-cell.htm"><b>invalidate-cell</b></a>, or force a whole
section to update by calling <a href="../../operators/cg/i/invalidate-section.htm"><b>invalidate-section</b></a>, or the whole
grid-widget by calling <a href="../../operators/cg/i/invalidate.htm"><b>invalidate</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="27">
There is a default <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> method that calls <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/write-to.htm"><b>princ-to-string</b></a> on the value
returned by <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a>, and draws that
string in the cell. If this is sufficient, then you do not need to
write your own <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> methods.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="28">
And here are the basic generic functions to specialize if you also
want to allow the user to modify the data interactively in the grid,
rather than simply viewing it:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="29">
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-click.htm"><b>cell-click</b></a> is
called when the user presses a mouse button over a cell, and <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-key-down.htm"><b>cell-key-down</b></a> is called
when the user presses a keyboard key while a cell has the keyboard
focus.  Methods can be written on these generic functions that decide
how to respond to the gestures and change the value that is
represented in a cell, and then to write the modified value back into
the application, typically by calling <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a>.  You may also
specialize <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-mouse-in.htm"><b>cell-mouse-in</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-mouse-out.htm"><b>cell-mouse-out</b></a> to respond in some
way as the mouse cursor enters and leaves various cells.
</li>
<li id="30">
<a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a>
modifies an application's data based on changes that a user has made
with interactive gestures in a grid cell.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="31">
Higher-Level Alternatives
</h3>

<p id="32">
The above generic functions are all that you need to specialize in
order to write your data-manipulating grid code from scratch.  But
there is some additional higher-level grid functionality that can
reduce the number of grid methods that must be written for typical
applications.
</p>
<p id="33">
These alternatives are applicable to any application that uses grid
rows to represent data objects and grid columns to represent their
properties.  For example, one of the Navigator grid examples uses grid
rows to represent employees, and grid columns to represent properties
such as employee name and department.  We will discuss that example
here.
</p>
<p id="34">
This higher-level functionality falls into two camps: reader and
writer properties, and cell widgets.
</p>

<h3 id="35">
Reader and Writer Properties
</h3>

<p id="36">
The first higher-level alternative lets you avoid writing <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> and
<a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a>
methods.  In an application such as the employee example, you would
probably have an employee class that already has accessor functions
such as <b>employee-name</b> and <b>employee-department</b>.  When
representing employees and their properties in a grid-widget, you
could specify the <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-object.htm"><b>data-object</b></a> property of each
<a href="grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a> as
the employee that the row represents, and specify the <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-reader.htm"><b>data-reader</b></a> property of
each <a href="grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> as the existing
accessor function (such as <b>employee-name</b> or
<b>employee-department</b>) for the property that the column
represents.  If you are allowing the user to modify data values in the
grid, then you could also specify a function such as <b>(setf
employee-name)</b> as the <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-writer.htm"><b>data-writer</b></a> property of the
column.
</p>
<p id="37">
It just so happens that the default <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> method calls the
grid column's data-reader function on the row's data-object, if both
of those exist.  And the default <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> method calls the
column's data-writer function on the data-object.  This means that by
specifying <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-object.htm"><b>data-object</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-reader.htm"><b>data-reader</b></a>, and <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-writer.htm"><b>data-writer</b></a> properties for your
grid subsections, you can avoid writing custom <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> methods
for various types of cells.  You can still write your own <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> methods that
call the default <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> method, though, and
write custom <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-click.htm"><b>cell-click</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-key-down.htm"><b>cell-key-down</b></a> methods that call the
default <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> method. See also
<a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-read-converter.htm"><b>data-read-converter</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-write-converter.htm"><b>data-write-converter</b></a>.
</p>

<h3 id="38">
Built-In Grid Cell Widgets
</h3>

<p id="39">
The other higher-level alternative lets you avoid writing custom
<a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-click.htm"><b>cell-click</b></a>, and
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-key-down.htm"><b>cell-key-down</b></a>
methods.  It consists of several types of built-in "cell widgets" that
know how to draw themselves and how to respond to user gestures to
modify the represented value.  When using these built-in cell widgets,
you can still write your own <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> methods
that will be called automatically by the built-in cell widget code.
Or use <b>both</b> of these higher-level alternatives together to
avoid writing any custom methods.
</p>
<p id="40">
Since there is not an object for each grid cell, the built-in cell
widgets are defined as mixin classes that you combine with a <a href="grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> class.
The defined classes are <a href="editable-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>editable-text-column-mixin</code></a>, <a href="check-box-column-mixin.htm"><code>check-box-column-mixin</code></a>, <a href="combo-box-column-mixin.htm"><code>combo-box-column-mixin</code></a>, <a href="static-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>static-text-column-mixin</code></a>,

<a href="static-text-and-button-column-mixin.htm"><code>static-text-and-button-column-mixin</code></a>,
<a href="pixmap-column-mixin.htm"><code>pixmap-column-mixin</code></a>, and
<a href="lamp-column-mixin.htm"><code>lamp-column-mixin</code></a>.
The pseudo-widget will appear in any cell whose column is an instance
of one of these mixin classes and whose row is an instance of the
<a href="widget-row-mixin.htm"><code>widget-row-mixin</code></a> class.  This
design lets you specify a type of widget for some subset of the cells
of a grid column.  This is appropriate for applications that use a
grid column to represent a property, since typically the same widget
would be appropriate for editing a particular property regardless of
which data object (grid row) is being edited.
</p>
<p id="41">
Typically you would have a header row or row-section that does not
have the <a href="widget-row-mixin.htm"><code>widget-row-mixin</code></a>, and then a number
of "body" rows that do have it, so that the widget does not appear in
the header row.  See also <a href="row-header-column.htm"><code>row-header-column</code></a> and <a href="column-header-row.htm"><code>column-header-row</code></a>.
</p>

<p id="42">
A quicker but less object-oriented way to use the built-in cell
widgets is to write <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-widget.htm"><b>cell-widget</b></a> methods. This bypasses the <a href="widget-column-mixin.htm"><code>widget-column-mixin</code></a> and <a href="widget-row-mixin.htm"><code>widget-row-mixin</code></a> classes
altogether, and allows the widgets to be used in arbitrary cells
rather than only in particular columns for each type of widget.
</p>

<h3 id="43">
Controlling the Built-In Draw-Cell Methods
</h3>

<p id="44">
If you are using a built-in <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> method that's supplied
by a cell widget, or the default method that displays any cell value
as a string, then you can still exert some control over how a cell
draws itself.  You do this by writing trivial methods that return
specific aspects of the drawing style.  The generic functions to
specialize include <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-font.htm"><b>cell-font</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-background-color.htm"><b>cell-background-color</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-foreground-color.htm"><b>cell-foreground-color</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-horizontal-padding.htm"><b>cell-horizontal-padding</b></a>, <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-vertical-padding.htm"><b>cell-vertical-padding</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-horizontal-justification.htm"><b>cell-horizontal-justification</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-vertical-justification.htm"><b>cell-vertical-justification</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-wrapped-p.htm"><b>cell-wrapped-p</b></a>,
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-3d-border.htm"><b>cell-3d-border</b></a>,
and <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-read-converter.htm"><b>data-read-converter</b></a>.  Each built-in
draw-cell method will call some subset of these generic functions and
use the values that they return.
</p>


<h3 id="45">
Caching Read-Cell-Value Values and Delaying Write-Cell-Value Calls
</h3>

<p id="46">
By default, an application's <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> method (or a <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-reader.htm"><b>data-reader</b></a> function that the default method
calls) is called every time a cell is drawn to return the value to
display.  If this code takes significant time, then these calls can be
minimized by setting the <a href="grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>'s <a href="../../operators/cg/c/cache-cell-values.htm"><b>cache-cell-values</b></a> property to true.
</p>
<p id="47">
Similarly by default, an application's <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> method (or a <a href="../../operators/cg/d/data-writer.htm"><b>data-writer</b></a> function that the default method
calls) is called immediately whenever the user interactively edits the
value in a grid cell.  To delay these calls that modify application
data until the user either confirms or rejects recent edits sometime
later, set the <a href="grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>'s <a href="../../operators/cg/d/delay-write-cell-value.htm"><b>delay-write-cell-value</b></a> property to true.
</p>


<h3 id="48">
Bypassing Read-Cell-Value and Write-Cell-Value Altogether
</h3>

<p id="49">
Perhaps it will be clear at this point that <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> and <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> exist
primarily because the higher-level grid features uses them to separate
the functionality that they provide from the methods that you still
have to write.  So if you are not using either higher-level
alternative, then a <a href="../../operators/cg/d/draw-cell.htm"><b>draw-cell</b></a> method actually would not
need to call a separate <a href="../../operators/cg/r/read-cell-value.htm"><b>read-cell-value</b></a> method, and could
instead fetch its application data to draw directly.  Similarly, a
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-click.htm"><b>cell-click</b></a> or
<a href="../../operators/cg/c/cell-key-down.htm"><b>cell-key-down</b></a>
method would not need to call a separate <a href="../../operators/cg/w/write-cell-value.htm"><b>write-cell-value</b></a> method, and could
instead modify the application's data directly.  The "simple color
editor" example in <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator Dialog</a> is an example of
this.
</p>

<h3 id="50">
Adding a Grid-Widget to a Form
</h3>

<p id="51">
A grid-widget can be added to a <a href="form.htm"><code>form</code></a> interactively as with other
widgets, but it is probably simpler to write all of its code
programmatically, due to the need to define subclasses and properties
for sub-components.  To usefully add a grid-widget to a form
interactively, you probably should first define the subclasses for
your grid-widget, sections and subsections, and give them
default-initargs that specify the properties that you would like for
their instances, and then call <a href="../../operators/ide/add-to-component-toolbar.htm"><b>add-to-component-toolbar</b></a> to add
your customized grid-widget class to the widget palette.
</p>

<p id="52">
A higher-level alternative that is already in the widget palette is
the <a href="class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>.  A <a href="class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> works well when created
interactively on a form because all of its customizable properties are
at the top level rather than on grid sections.
</p>


<h3 id="53">
