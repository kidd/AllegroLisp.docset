<p id="3"><img src="../pictures/new-form1.jpg"></p>

<p id="4">
This dialog is displayed by the <a href="file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New Form</a> menu
command. It creates a new <a href="form-dialog.htm">form</a> window for interactively laying out
the widgets of an application window.  A name for the new application
window may be specified here (see <a href="../operators/cg/n/name.htm"><b>name</b></a>), along with the window class
that will be instantiated for it (see <a href="../operators/cg/d/device.htm"><b>device</b></a>).
</p>
<p id="5">
A form window must be part of a project.  If there is no current
project, then the New Form command will instruct you to first use the
<a href="file-menu.htm#new-project">File
| New Project</a> command or the <a href="file-menu.htm#open-project">File | Open Project</a>
command.
</p>

<h4 id="6">
The Window Name
</h4>

<p id="7">
The first widget on the New Form dialog is for the name of the new
application window.  This is a symbol by which the window may be found
with functions such as <a href="../operators/cg/f/find-window.htm"><b>find-window</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/f/find-application-window.htm"><b>find-application-window</b></a>.  A keyword
is recommended to avoid package considerations.  This name will also
be the suggested filename for the form when you save the form for the
first time.
</p>
<p id="8">
The name is also used to name the <a href="../operators/ide/finder-function.htm"><b>finder-function</b></a> and <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a> that are
automatically generated for creating the form's window.  For example,
if the form name is <b>my-main-window</b>, then a <a href="../operators/ide/finder-function.htm"><b>finder-function</b></a> named
<b>my-main-window</b> and a <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a> named
<b>make-my-main-window</b> will be generated, and may be called by
your application code to find and/or make the window.
</p>
<p id="9">
So it is a good idea to initially assign a useful name for the new
form, though you can also use the inspector to change the name
property of the form at any time.  The <a href="../operators/ide/finder-function.htm"><b>finder-function</b></a> and <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a> will then
be named according to the new form name the next time the form is
saved.
</p>

<h4 id="10">
The Window Class
</h4>

<p id="11">
The other two widgets on the <a href="new-form-dialog.htm">New Form</a> dialog are for the class to
instantiate to create the application window.  The list widget at the
left includes a set of built-in instantiable window classes, plus any
subclasses of these classes that you have already defined.  The class
that is selected here will be the class of the application window if
no new subclass name is entered in the widget to the right, and
otherwise will be the direct superclass of the new subclass that is
created.
</p>
<p id="12">
A symbol to name a new subclass for this application window may
optionally be entered into the widget at the lower right.  If a name
is entered, then a <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defclass.htm"><b>defclass</b></a> form is automatically
generated and evaluated to define a subclass with this name, with the
class selected from the list to the left as a direct superclass.  It
may be desirable to define a subclass for each application window, so
that methods that are specific to it may be written.
</p>

<h4 id="13">Creating the Form</h4>

<p id="14">
When the new form is created, a form window will appear, allowing you
to place widgets onto it from the Components Toolbar.  An inspector
will also appear for a new form if no inspector was already present.
To place a widget onto a form, just click a button in the Components
Toolbar for the desired type of widget, and then click in the form
window to place it there.  Left-click a widget on the form to edit its
properties in the Inspector (double-clicking also exposes the
Inspector).
</p>
<p id="15">
Creating a new form will also create a new editor buffer into which
you can write source code related to this application window.  If you
have requested a new subclass for the window, then the generated
<a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defclass.htm"><b>defclass</b></a>
expression for the new class will be written into this editor buffer,
and you can modify it anytime later to add slots and so on.
Additional source code will be generated into this buffer if you use
the inspector to create event-handler starter functions for widgets on
the form; this is done while inspecting a widget by clicking on the
small button beside an event-handler property on the <b>Events</b> tab of
the Inspector.
</p>

<h4 id="16">
Saving the Form
</h4>

<p id="17">
You can save a form by using the <a href="file-menu.htm#save">File | Save</a> command whenever
either the form window itself or its associated editor buffer is
selected.  This saves the editor buffer for the form (if present) to
its <i>.cl</i> file, and also generates a file with the
same name except for a file type of <i>.bil</i>; this
generated file contains code for creating the application window with
the widgets that you have laid out interactively (see <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a>).
</p>
<p id="18">
User-written code associated with a form does not have to be placed
into the suggested <i>.cl</i> file, but doing so helps
keep the code organization tidy.  In particular, a form's
<i>.cl</i> file is loaded just before its
<i>.bil</i> file, and having the defclass expression for
a form in the <i>.cl</i> file ensures that it is loaded
before it is used by the <i>.bil</i> file.
