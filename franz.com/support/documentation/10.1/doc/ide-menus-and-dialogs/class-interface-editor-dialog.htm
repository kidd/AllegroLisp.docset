<p id="3">
The IDE's Class Interface Editor dialog is used to interactively
create a graphical user interface (GUI) for editing the instances of a
class. Typically this user interface is for editing information in an
AllegroCache database, though it could be used to edit arbitrary class
instances.
</p>
<p id="4">
You can use the Class Interface Editor to edit either an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> dialog or a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> widget.  An
object-editor dialog contains a widget for each slot of interest,
while a class-grid widget contains a grid column for each slot
instead.  These interface objects will automatically create and lay
out their widgets or grid columns according high-level parameters that
you specify interactively.
</p>
<p id="5">
Specifically, the Class Interface Editor lets you specify the value of
the <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property of
an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> or <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>.  You could alternately
specify this property programmatically; see the doc page for the
<a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property as well
as the document <a href="../cg/cg-object-editor-and-class-grid.htm">cg-object-editor-and-class-grid.htm</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="6">
Bringing Up the Class Interface Editor
</h2>

<p id="7">
The Class Interface Editor is normally used on a form window in a
project so that code for recreating the interface objects is saved
with the project.  So starting from scratch you would create a new
project with the <a href="file-menu.htm#new-project">File | New
Project</a> command.  Then you would create
either (1) an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>
form or (2) a generic form with a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> on it.
</p>
<p id="8">
<b>To create an object-editor form</b>, use the <a href="file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New
Form</a>
command as usual.  The key step is to select object-editor in the
Window Class widget of the New Form dialog that appears.  You will
then be asked to enter the name of a class for the object-editor to
edit.  You must enter a class name at this time or the new form will
not be created.  It's OK to type in the name of a class that doesn't
exist yet, though, such as a class in a database that you haven't
opened yet.
</p>
<p id="9">
<b>To create a standalone class-grid on a generic form</b>, first use
the File | New Form command to create some other type of form,
typically a dialog.  Then click on the Class Grid button in the
Components Toolbar (the button shows a grid with header cells plus a
red "C" in the body) and then click on the form window.  This will
create a sample class-grid for the class test-person.  You may want to
run the form with its sample property values to see how it works.
Once you've done that, you will probably want to inspect the widget
and change its value property to nil to remove the sample rows.  Then
change the edited-class property to be the name of a class to edit,
since you are not prompted for that as with an object-editor.
</p>
<p id="10">
In case you were wondering, a class-grid can also be used on an
object-editor, but that's done in a different way that's covered
toward the end of this document.
</p>
<p id="11">
Now that you have an object-editor form or a class-grid on a form,
there are three ways to invoke the Class Interface Editor dialog on
it:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="12">

Right-click the object-editor form or class-grid and select <b>Edit
Class Interface</b> from the pop-up menu.

</li>
<li id="13">

Inspect the object-editor or class-grid, select the <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property, and click the small
button on the right end of that inspector row.

</li>
<li id="14">

For an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> only,
select the module for the object-editor form on the Project Manager's
General tab, and then click on the button in the Project Manager's
toolbar whose tooltip is <b>Edit Class Interface</b>. (The two
horizontal green bars on this button represent two single-line text
widgets aligned in a column on an object-editor, if you appreciate
minimalism.)

</li>
</ol>

<p id="15">
Here is a Class Interface Editor editing the class <b>dialog</b>, just
for illustration:
</p>
<p id="16"><img src="../pictures/class-int-ed.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="17">
Including Particular Slots in the User Interface
</h2>
<p id="18">
When the Class Interface Editor appears, a list of all of the slots of
the edited class will appear in the <b>Slots</b> widget at the left.
If this is a new object-editor or class-grid, then all slot names will
be grayed out because no slots have been selected yet for inclusion in
the user interface.
</p>
<p id="19">
Click on the name of a slot that you would like to include in the
interface, and then click the <b>Include</b> check-box near the top of
the Class Interface Editor.  This will make the rest of the widgets in
the Widget group-box available so that you can specify how that slot
should be edited by the end user.  The slot name will also turn from
gray to black in the list of all slots, though you can't see that
while the slot is selected.
</p>
<p id="20">
You may now specify how this slot will appear in the interface.  For
example, in the <b>Label</b> widget you could type a string to display
beside the widget for the slot on an object-editor, or in a column
header for the slot in a class-grid.  If you leave the label widget
blank, the default label will be the slot name with dashes converted
to spaces, and each word capitalized.
</p>

<h2 id="21">
Specifying the Data Type (and Widget Type) for Each Slot
</h2>

<p id="22">
The most interesting part of the Class Interface Editor is in the
<b>Data Type</b> group-box.  Here is where you specify what sort of
data is in an edited slot, and therefore what type of widget or grid
column should be used for editing the slot.  The <b>Type Name</b>
widget is where you select the main data type for the slot.  When you
select a main type, one or more additional widgets may appear just
below; these widgets allow you to specify various options for the
selected type.
</p>
<p id="23">
The data type choices are not lisp types, but rather types that
pertain to how the value may be edited.  There are several different
data type choices that are used for lisp strings, for example.
</p>
<p id="24">
The default type for any slot is <b>Variable Char</b>, which means
that the value may be a string of any length.  If you are creating an
<a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>, then a
simple <a href="../classes/cg/editable-text.htm"><code>editable-text</code></a> widget
will be created for editing that slot.  If you are creating a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>, then an <a href="../classes/cg/editable-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>editable-text-column-mixin</code></a>&nbsp;
<a href="../classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> will be created
for the slot.
</p>
<p id="25">
If you change the type in the <b>Type Name</b> widget to <b>Fixed
Char</b>, then a <b>Max Characters</b> widget will appear.  This
widget allows you to specify the maximum number of characters that a
string in this slot can have.  An <a href="../classes/cg/editable-text.htm"><code>editable-text</code></a> widget will still be created for
the slot, but it will have a <a href="../operators/cg/t/template-string.htm"><b>template-string</b></a> that restricts the user to
entering the specified number of characters.
</p>
<p id="26">
There are a variety of other choices for the data type.  For example,
<b>Boolean</b> will create a <a href="../classes/cg/check-box.htm"><code>check-box</code></a>, <b>Single Choice</b> a <a href="../classes/cg/combo-box.htm"><code>combo-box</code></a>, <b>Multiple Choice</b> a
<a href="../classes/cg/multi-item-list.htm"><code>multi-item-list</code></a> (for an
<a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> only), and
<b>Pixmap</b> will create a <a href="../classes/cg/static-picture.htm"><code>static-picture</code></a> (or a <a href="../classes/cg/pixmap-column-mixin.htm"><code>pixmap-column-mixin</code></a> column in a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>).  These choices are
documented more fully on the doc page for the <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property, but here are notes on how
to specify a couple of the less obvious ones on the Class Interface
Editor:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="27">

<b>Single Choice and Multiple Choice</b>: For these types a multi-line
text-editing widget will appear on the Class Interface Editor where
you can enter a set of hardcoded choices from which the end user can
select values.  If you check the <b>Choices Are Strings</b> check-box,
then each line of text that you enter will be used as one choice, and
the choice will be a that actual string.  If <b>Choices Are
Strings</b> is not checked, then lisp objects (typically symbols and
numbers) will be read from the text that you entered until the end of
the text is reached, and those lisp objects will be the choices.

</li>
<li id="28">

<b>Pixmap and Static Pixmap</b>: this is the one where it is least
obvious how to specify the options.  The multi-line text-editing
widget will appear as with <b>Single Choice and Multiple Choice</b>,
but you need to enter values carefully in a certain format.  Each line
of text is used to map an arbitrary slot value to a pixmap to
represent it.  A line of text should contain text that will be read as
two lisp values, where the first value is the arbitrary slot value and
the second value is the name of a pixmap that has been cached by
calling cached-pixmap.  If a user value is a string then it should
have double quote characters around it here.  If a user value is not a
"readable constant" then the Class Interface Editor cannot be used to
specify a pixmap interface for it.  So entering the following text
would cause the pixmap named <code>:key</code> to be displayed
for the slot value <code>:partial</code>, the pixmap named
<code>:key-special</code> to be displayed for the slot value
<code>:full</code>, and the pixmap named
<code>:melvin</code> to be displayed for the slot value "Melvin
Ferd" (the string):

<pre id="29">
    :partial :key
    :full :key-special
    "Melvin Ferd" :melvin
</pre>

<p id="30">
If the <b>Pixmaps Will Strech</b> check-box is checked then the
pixmaps will be stretched larger or smaller as needed to fill the
available space in the widget or grid cell, and otherwise they will be
drawn at their normal sizes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="31">
Ordering Widgets and Grid Columns
</h2>

<p id="32">
The Class Interface Editor will create widgets or grid columns in the
order that they appear in the list of all slots (ignoring the slots
that are not included).  This will be widgets from top to bottom in an
object-editor dialog, or grid columns from left to right in a
class-grid.  You can therefore change the order in the list of slots
to control the widget order.  The <b>Move All Included Slots to the
Top</b> button may by handy to use first in order to group all of the
currently-included slots together at the top of the list.  You can
then move individual slots using the Up and Down buttons, or more
quickly by left-clicking and dragging slot names to new positions.
</p>
<p id="33">
If you are creating an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> rather than a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>, then there will also be a <b>New
Column</b> check-box.  By default, an object-editor will lay out its
widgets in a single vertical column.  The exception is that if you
check the <b>New Column</b> check-box for a particular slot, then a
new column of widgets will be started at the widget for that slot.
That can save space vertically.
</p>

<h2 id="34">
Modifying the Created Widgets and Reinvoking the Class Interface Editor
</h2>

<p id="35">
Pressing the <b>OK</b> button will exit the Class Interface Editor,
which will then automatically create or update widgets or grid columns
as needed to match your specifications.  You can then edit the widgets
further using the inspector just as you would widgets on a regular
form, and move and resize the widgets or grid-columns with the mouse.
You can even add other arbitrary widgets to an object-editor form.
The Class Interface Editor doesn't have facilities for specifying
properties like a widget's size or font because that would be
redundant with the more general tools.
</p>
<p id="36">
After editing the created widgets of an object-editor directly, you
can invoke the Class Interface Editor again at any time.  A
reinvocation will never resize an existing widget unless you change
the data type so that a different type of widget will be substituted.
It will not undo general property changes that you have made in the
inspector.  And by default the only widgets that it will move are any
new widgets that it adds for additonal slots that you tell it to
include; these new widgets will be arranged below all widgets that
existed already (other than the lower row of command buttons, which
will still be kept at the bottom).  Added widgets will be aligned with
each other but not with the pre-existing widgets.
</p>
<p id="37">
If you check the <b>Redo Entire Widget Layout</b> check-box before
exiting the Class Interface Editor, then it will move all widgets
(other than any that you created by hand) to align them just as if you
had created them all at once.  Existing widgets will still not be
resized.  So if you have begun moving widgets around directly on the
object-editor form, then you should not check <b>Redo Entire Widget
Layout</b> thereafter, or else it will undo any direct moving of
widgets that you have done.  On the other hand, if you have not yet
moved any widgets directly on the form then you probably DO want to
check <b>Redo Entire Widget Layout</b> on each re-invocation of the
Class Interface Editor in order to keep all widgets nicely aligned,
and in the same order as in the Slots widget.  This check-box is never
turned on by default to make it less likely that you will accidentally
leave it enabled and undo your careful hand-positioning of widgets.
This check-box will not appear when editing a class-grid because the
grid columns will always be arranged to match the order in the Slots
widget.
</p>

<h2 id="38">
Including Standard Command Buttons on an Object-Editor
</h2>

<p id="39">
If you are creating an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> rather than a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>, then there will be a <b>Buttons</b>
widget in the lower right corner.  Here you can select any subset of
several built-in command buttons that let the user do things such as
selecting an instance to display in various ways, or reverting from
the current edits.  These buttons call exported functions, so
alternately you could add your own widgets to the object-editor form
later and make them call these same functions.  The set of buttons and
the functions they call are documented on the page for the <a href="../operators/cg/c/command-buttons.htm"><b>command-buttons</b></a> property.
</p>

<h2 id="40">
The Primary and Secondary Name Slots
</h2>

<p id="41">
These widgets let you specify one or two slots whose values will be
used as a "pretty name" for an instance.  The pretty name will be
displayed in widgets that hold class instances, and in menus for
selecting instances.  The drop-down lists for these widgets let you
select any slot.
</p>
<p id="42">
These widgets usually edit values for the <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-class.htm"><b>edited-class</b></a> of the object-editor or class-grid
that you are editing in the Class Interface Editor.  An exception is
that if a slot uses one of the data types for class instances (see
further below), then the Primary and Secondary Name Slots widgets will
edit values for that slot's class whenever it is selected in the list
of all slots.
</p>
<p id="43">
For more information see <a href="../operators/cg/p/primary-name-slot.htm"><b>primary-name-slot</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/s/secondary-name-slot.htm"><b>secondary-name-slot</b></a>.
</p>

<h2 id="44">
Other Widgets on the Class Interface Editor
</h2>

<p id="45">
The <b>Fixed-Width Font</b> check-box will be checked by default
whenever you select a data type that requires a fixed number of
characters.  You can override that default by toggling this check-box
yourself.  A widget will use the current global CG <a href="../operators/cg/f/fixed-font.htm"><b>fixed-font</b></a> when this check-box is checked, or
the current <a href="../operators/cg/p/proportional-font.htm"><b>proportional-font</b></a>
otherwise.  (You could change a widget's font in the inspector as
usual after the widget gets automatically created.)
</p>
<p id="46">
If you are creating an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> rather than a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>, then there will an Include <b>Table
of All Instances</b> check-box.  If you check this widget, then a
special class-grid will be included at the very bottom of the dialog.
This class-grid will have a row for every instance of the edited class
(and so would probably not be very useful if there is a huge number of
instances).  The end user can edit instances here as an alternative to
doing so in the main part of the dialog.  Selecting an instance in the
grid will display it in the rest of the dialog as well.
</p>


<p id="47">
If you are creating a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>, then there will be a few other
widgets.  Three of these are check boxes for whether the grid column
will be resizable, proportional, and/or sortable.  A resizable
<a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> column allows
the user to change its width by dragging the right edge of its header
cell.  A proportional column will be resized proportionally when the
width of the <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>
itself changes.  And a sortable grid column allows the user to sort
the grid rows by that column's values by clicking the column's header
cell.
</p>
<p id="48">
One other widget for class-grids that will appear, though only for
certain data types, is the <b>Printer</b> widget.  Its value should be
the name of a function that takes a data value and returns the string
to display for it.  It defaults to <b>princ-to-string</b>.
</p>


<h2 id="49">
Miscellaneous Other Notes
</h2>

<p id="50">
In the list of all slots, a persistent slot whose index attribute is
<code>:any</code> will display a yellow key with a single prong,
and an index attribute of <code>:any-unique</code> will display
a green key with two prongs.
</p>

<h2 id="51">
Getting Fancy: Indirect Editing of Objects That Are In Slots
</h2>

<p id="52">
The data type choices for slots that hold class instances are of
particular interest in the Class Interface Editor.  In the <b>Type
Name</b> widget, if you select Class Instance, Static Class Instance,
or Table of Class Instances, then a Class widget will appear where you
can enter the class whose instances the slot holds.  Any classes that
are defined in the currently open AllegroCache database will be listed
in the drop-down list for easy selection; otherwise you can type in
the name of the class.  You will then be able to add widgets or grid
columns that edit slots of these instances indirectly.
</p>
<p id="53">
For example, if you are creating an object-editor that edits instances
of the <code>patient</code> class, and a patient has a
<b>doctor</b> slot that holds an instance of the
<code>doctor</code> class, then you could select the doctor slot
in the list at the left, set its main data type to Class Instance, and
its Class to doctor.  At this time a blue arrow will appear beside the
doctor slot in the list of all slots.  Clicking this arrow will reveal
a sublist containing the slots of the doctor class.  If you then
specify a widget for the phone-number slot of the doctor class, then
the object-editor for the patient class will include a widget for the
phone number of the doctor of the currently-displayed patient.  (If
you don't want the end user to be able to change the doctor's phone
number while editing a patient, then you should probably specify the
Static Text type for that slot.)
</p>
<p id="54">
If a slot holds a list of instances of some class, and you are
creating an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>
rather than a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>,
then you can specify the Table of Class Instances type for that slot.
This will create a class-grid on the object-editor, where the grid
will have a row for each instance in the list.
</p>
<p id="55">
For example, the <code>patient</code> class could have a
<b>prescriptions</b> slot that holds a list of instances of the
prescription class.  If you are creating an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> for the patient class, then you
could select the prescriptions slot in the list of all slots, then set
its main data type to Table of Class Instances and its Class to
prescription.  This will create a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> on the <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> for patient that displays a row
for each prescription of the currently-displayed patient.
</p>
<p id="56">
This sort of indirection can be carried to any practical number of
levels.  For example, the prescriptions table could have a column for
the medicine of the prescription of the patient and an indirect column
for the manufacturer of the medicine of the prescription of the
patient.  In the Class Interface Editor, a new level of slot names
will be made available for selection whenever you specify one of the
class instance data types at a preceding level.
</p>
<p id="57">
When specifying a Table of Class Instances on an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>, there is also a list of buttons
that you can select that go along with the <a href="../classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> that gets created.  These buttons
will create, delete, add, or remove instances in the list of instances
that the table's slot contains.  This allows the end user to edit the
actual list of instances, rather than only to edit each instance
that's in the list already.  The <b>Create</b> button allows the user
to create an instance and add it to the list, while the <b>Add</b>
button allows the user to select an existing instance from a menu and
add it to the list.  Similarly, the <b>Delete</b> button will remove
an instance from the list and delete the instance, while the
<b>Remove</b> button simply removes the instance from the list without
deleting the instance itself.  In the prescriptions table example, the
<b>Create</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons are more appropriate because a
prescription is unique to a particular patient. If the table held a
list of medicine instances instead, where there is only a single
instance for each medicine product, then the <b>Add</b> and
<b>Remove</b> buttons would be more appropriate.
