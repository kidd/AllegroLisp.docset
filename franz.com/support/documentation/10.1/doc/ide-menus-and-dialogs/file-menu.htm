<p id="3">
The file menu displays commands mostly dealing with opening, closing
and saving files or groups of files (a project is a group of
files). The commands on the menu are:
</p>

<ul><li id="4"><b><a name="new">New</a></b> --  Creates an empty buffer in the IDE Editor for a new source
code file (or other text file).  You will be asked for a pathname for
the new file the first time you invoke the <a href="file-menu.htm#save">Save</a>
command on this buffer.
</li></ul>


<ul><li id="5"><b><a name="new-form">New Form</a></b> -- 
Displays a <a href="new-form-dialog.htm">New
Form</a> dialog which allows creating a new form and adding it to
the current project.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="6"><b><a name="new-project">New Project</a></b> -- 
Creates a new project, which is then known as the
"current project" that is being developed in the IDE.  The previous
current project if any is closed (after prompting to save changes if
needed).
<p id="7">
The directory-choosing dialog first appears asking for a default
directory for the project's files.  A project's files do not have to
be placed into this directory, but having a default directory allows
the IDE to default the file-selecting dialog to a directory that
typically is convenient. The immediate parent directory name will also
be the initial name of the project and its <i>.lpr</i>
project definition file; for example, if you specify the directory
<code>c:/allegro-projects/first/</code>, then the next <a href="file-menu.htm#save-all">File | Save
All</a> that is done will save the project definition file as
<i>c:/allegro-projects/first/first.lpr</i>.  (The
project name could be changed later in the <a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager</a> dialog's
<a href="project-manager-dialog-options.htm">Options</a> tab, and its
pathname could be changed by invoking <a href="file-menu.htm#save-as">File | Save As</a> while the
<a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a> is the selected window.)
</p>
<p id="8">
In addition, the first time a project is created there will be an
earlier invocation of the directory dialog asking for a default parent
directory for all new IDE projects.  This default parent directory is
used as the initially-selected parent directory whenever a new project
asks for a default directory for that particular project.  This dialog
will not reappear as long as the allegro-ide-options.cl file is
created and retained as usual, though the value could still be changed
by setting the <a href="../operators/ide/project-parent-directory.htm"><b>project-parent-directory</b></a> configuration option.
</p>
<p id="9">
The project system does not have to be used for an application, but is
necessary for building form windows interactively, and for using the
<a href="file-menu.htm#build-project-exe">File | Build Project
Executable</a> and <a href="file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> commands rather than writing a call to <a href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="10">
See also <a href="../operators/ide/new-project-show-project-manager.htm"><b>new-project-show-project-manager</b></a>, <a href="../operators/ide/new-project-show-editor.htm"><b>new-project-show-editor</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/ide/new-project-create-form.htm"><b>new-project-create-form</b></a>.
</p>
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="11"><b><a name="open">Open</a></b> -- 
Displays a source code file (or other plain-text file) in the editor
for viewing and/or editing, after displaying a dialog to ask for the
file to open.  If an editor buffer is currently selected and <a href="../operators/ide/context-sensitive-default-path.htm"><b>context-sensitive-default-path</b></a> is
true, then the file dialog will default to the directory of that
buffer's file, if any, and otherwise will default as usual to the
directory from which a file was most recently selected with the file
dialog.  (On the very first invocation of the file dialog, the
directory defaults according to <a href="../operators/ide/start-in-allegro-directory.htm"><b>start-in-allegro-directory</b></a>.)
<p id="12">
The contents of the Files of Type field of the dialog is controlled by
the value of the IDE configuration option 
<a href="../operators/ide/source-file-types.htm"><b>source-file-types</b></a>.
That option controls
the type field for this <b>File | Open</b> command and for the dialog
displayed by the <a href="file-menu.htm#save-as">File | Save As</a> when saving an Editor file. 
</p>
<p id="13">
On GTK, to include dot files and other hidden files in the dialog's
list, you would need to specify <code>ShowHidden=true</code> in
the file <b>~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini</b>. But you can always
type the name of a hidden file even if it's not shown in the list.
</p>
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="14"><b><a name="open-project">Open Project</a></b> -- 
Displays a dialog for choosing an existing project to
further develop in the IDE.  The project is then known as the <i>current
project</i>.  The previous current project if any is first closed (after
prompting to save changes if needed).  If any of the project's form
windows were visible (not shrunk) when the project was last saved,
then the first such form will be inspected in an Inspector window.
<p id="15">
If the <a href="../operators/ide/open-project-show-files-in-editor.htm"><b>open-project-show-files-in-editor</b></a> configuration
option is true, then each of the project's source code files will be
opened in the editor.  The Project Manager will be shown if <a href="../operators/ide/open-project-show-project-manager.htm"><b>open-project-show-project-manager</b></a> is
true.  The project's code will be compiled and loaded according to the
current value of the <a href="../operators/ide/open-project-action.htm"><b>open-project-action</b></a> option.
</p>
<p id="16">
There is also an Open Project item on the 
<a href="recent-menu.htm">Recent</a> menu. It
displays a submenu of projects that have recently been opened, loaded,
or saved, either in the current invocation of Lisp or a recent
one. Selecting one of the projects opens it as the current project for
editing.
</p>
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="17"><b><a name="close-pane">Close Pane</a></b> -- 
Close the current editor buffer in the editor workbook. If the pane
being closed is the only pane, the editor workbook is closed as well.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="18"><b><a name="close-window">Close Window</a></b> -- 
Closes the selected window. Do not use this command to close a buffer
in the Editor workbook as it will close the entire workbook, not just
a single buffer. Use <a href="file-menu.htm#close-pane">File | Close Pane</a> to close an editor buffer.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="19"><b><a name="close-all-allegro-dialogs">Close All Allegro Dialogs</a></b> --  Displayed when a dialog is the
selected window. Closes all dialogs except the Inspector (and the
Debug window, Editor Workbook, and any forms). The result is the
screen has roughly the same windows as when Allegro CL starts. All
dialogs can be reopened later, of course.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="20"><b><a name="close-all-inspectors">Close All Inspectors</a></b> -- 
Displayed when an Inspector window is selected. Closes all Inspector
windows. Display a new inspector with <a href="view-menu.htm#new-inspector">View | New
Inspector</a>.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="21"><b><a name="close-all-forms">Close All Forms</a></b> -- 
Displayed when a form is the selected window. Closes all
forms. <a href="file-menu.htm#new-form">File |
New Form</a> creates a new, blank form.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="22"><b><a name="close-all-editors">Close All Editors</a></b> -- 
Displayed when the Editor workbook is the selected window. Closes all
editor workbooks. <a href="view-menu.htm#new-editor">View | New Editor</a> displays a
new editor workbook (whether or not one currently exists).
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="23"><b><a name="close-all-class-graphs">Close All Class Graphs</a></b> -- 
Displayed when a class graph window (as displayed by, say, <a href="tools-menu.htm#graph-subclasses">Tools | Graph
Subclasses</a>) is selected.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="24"><b><a name="close-all-runtime-analyzer-graphs">Close All Runtime Analyzer Graphs</a></b> --  Displayed
when a analysis graph window is selected. Closes all runtime analyzer
graph windows.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="25"><b><a name="save">Save</a></b> -- 
Saves the contents of the currently selected IDE window to a
file, if that window supports the Save command.
<p id="26">
When the editor is selected, the text in the selected editor buffer is
saved.  If a new buffer is being saved for the first time, the file
dialog will first ask for a pathname for the file.  If the editor
buffer is for the <i>.cl</i> file that is associated
with a form window, then the form's <i>.bil</i> file is
also generated at this time (see <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a>).
</p>
<p id="27">
If there is a current project, you will first be asked whether you
would like to add the new file to the project.  If you answer yes,
then the file dialog will default to the current project's default
directory, and the file will be added to the project after it is
saved.  If you answer no, then the file-selecting dialog will default
as it otherwise would to the directory in which a file was last
selected in the file dialog.
</p>
<p id="28">
The <b>Save</b> command may also be used in certain other IDE windows.
For example, when the focus is in a listener in the Debug Window, the
text in the listener will be saved.  In a form window, the form's
<i>.bil</i> file is generated (see <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a>) and its associated
<i>.cl</i> file in the editor (if any) is saved.  In a
stack backtrace, a bug report that contains the stack information will
be written.  In the Trace Dialog's outline widget, the trace
information will be written as indented text.  In the Inspector, the
currently displayed table of values will be written.  In the Project
Manager dialog, the current project's <i>.lpr</i>
project definition file will be written.
</p>

<p id="29">
In some windows (the <a href="class-browser-dialog.htm">Class Browser</a>,
the <a href="trace-dialog.htm">Trace
Dialog</a>, the <a href="runtime-analyzer-results-dialog.htm">Runtime Analyzer
Results</a> dialog, the <a href="inspect-dialog.htm">Inspector</a> panes, and the backtrace pane
in <a href="debug-window-after-error.htm">Debug
window after an error</a>) the text is actually written to a new
editor buffer rather than to a file, to avoid the requirement to
specify a pathname and create a file when you just want to view or
copy the text.  You can then use this same <b>Save</b> command in the
editor buffer if you do want to save the text to a file.
</p>

</li></ul>



<ul><li id="30"><b><a name="save-as">Save As</a></b> --  Generally does the same thing as the <b>Save</b>
command, except always first asking for a new pathname. 
<p id="31">
You cannot use <b>Save As</b> when the Project Manager Dialog is the
selected window. <b>Save</b> in that case saves the current project's
<i>.lpr</i> project definition file, but that file
should have the same filename as the project name, so it is
inappropriate to use this command to modify the filename. Instead,
change the name of the project (in the <a href="project-manager-dialog-options.htm">Options</a> tab of the
<a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a>) and say yes when asked if you want the
<i>.lpr</i> name changed as well. To move the project
files to a new directory, close the project, copy all the project
files to the new directory using standard Operating System tools (such
as the Windows Explorer) and then reopen the project from its new
location.
</p>
</li></ul>


<ul><li id="32"><b><a name="save-all">Save All</a></b> --  Saves each editor buffer and form window that has
unsaved changes, as well as the current project's
<i>.lpr</i> file when there are unsaved changes to the
project itself.  When the file dialog appears to ask for a pathname
for an object that has not yet been saved (perhaps a scratch editor
buffer), canceling the dialog will skip that object without canceling
the saving of other objects.  A status-bar message will mention which
objects were saved and which were skipped, or that nothing needs to be
saved. This menu command is
also on the right button menu (shortcut menu) over the background
window. See <a href="view-menu.htm#background-window">View | Background
Window</a>.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="33"><b><a name="revert-to-saved">Revert to Saved</a></b> -- 
Replaces the current contents of an editor buffer with the contents of the
file associated with the buffer. Changes since the last save are thus
discarded.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="34"><b><a name="compile">Compile</a></b> -- 
Displays a dialog to choose a Lisp source file to compile. The file is
not loaded after compilation.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="35"><b><a name="load">Load</a></b> -- 
Displays a dialog to choose a file to load.  The file must be either a
compiled Lisp file (<i>fasl</i> file), a lisp source
code file, or a <i>.lpr</i> project definition file.  If
a <i>fasl</i> file or source code file is specified,
then cl:load is called on that file directly.  If a project definition
file is specified, then <a href="../operators/ide/load-project.htm"><b>load-project</b></a> is called to load the
project.  (A loaded project may be used in the IDE, but is not the
"current project" that is open for further development.)
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="36"><b><a name="compile-and-load">Compile and Load</a></b> -- 
Displays a dialog to choose a Lisp source file to compile. The
compiled file is then loaded.
</li></ul>





<ul><li id="37"><b><a name="build-project-exe">Build Project Executable</a></b> --  Creates a standalone executable
file for the current project in the main directory of the project.
(An associated dxl file is also created, which gets loaded by the
executable file.)  This allows running the application by itself,
outside of any development environment. The license file devel.lic is
copied to the project directory from the Allegro directory, allowing
the project executable to be run. Note that this directory is not
suitable for distribution under a VAR agreement
(use <a href="file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">Build Project Distribution</a>
for that.
<p id="38">
If the name of the project (as specified on the <a href="project-manager-dialog-options.htm">Options</a> tab of the
<a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a> dialog) is <b>my-application</b>, for example, then
the executable file will be named <b>my-application</b> on Linux or
Mac, or
<b>my-application.exe</b> on Windows.  The dxl file will be named
<b>my-application.dxl</b>.
</p>
<p id="39">
<a href="../operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> is
used to build the new image.
</p>
<p id="40">
See also <a href="../operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>, which
is a programmatic equivalent of this menu command.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li id="41"><b><a name="build-project-distribution">Build Project Distribution</a></b> --  This command does
everything that <a href="file-menu.htm#build-project-exe">Build Project Executable</a> does, and
then also collects all files that are needed for distributing the
application to others into a directory that you specify. A license
file suitable for distribution under a VAR agreement is also placed in
the directory.
<p id="42">
The default
distribution directory will be a subdirectory of the project's main
directory named <b>dist</b>.  The additional files will include a
license file, plus any shared libraries that are internally known to
be needed, along with any libraries and other arbitrary distributed
files that you have specifically added to the project.
</p>
<p id="43">
<a href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>
is called to do much of the work of this menu command.
</p>
<p id="44">
See also
<a href="../operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>, which is a
programmatic equivalent of this menu command. Note that on Macs and
Linus machines, your user must have X11 and GTK
installed. See <a href="../delivery.htm#user-configuration-1">Users of your app must have necessary
software installed (such as X11 and GTK)</a>
in <a href="../delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a> for more information.

<ul><li id="46"><b><a name="print">Print</a></b> -- 
Prints the contents of the currently selected IDE window or
widget, if that window or widget supports the Print command.  This is
typically used in the editor to print a source code file.
