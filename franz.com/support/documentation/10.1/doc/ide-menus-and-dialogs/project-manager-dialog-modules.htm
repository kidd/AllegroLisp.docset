<p id="3"><img src="../pictures/pm-doodler.jpg"></p>



<p id="4">
This tab on the <a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager Dialog</a> lists
the modules in the project. 
</p>
<p id="5">
The static-text widget at the top of this tab displays the default
directory for the project, which is simply the directory that contains
the project's <i>.lpr</i> project definition file.  The
large list widget just below displays the project's modules in the
order in which they are loaded.  The pathname shown for each module is
relative to the project's default directory.  (The module paths are
stored that way so that they are still correct if the project
directory is moved.)
</p>
<h3 id="6">
Module Types and the Files They Contain
</h3>
<p id="7">
Each module of a project is of one of several standard module types.
The types are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="8">
source code
</li>
<li id="9">
form
</li>
<li id="10">
sub-project
</li>
<li id="11">
shared library
</li>
<li id="12">
distributed file
</li>

<li id="13">
distributed directory
</li>
<li id="14">
editable file
</li>

</ul>
<p id="15">
Each type is represented in the Project Manager by a particular icon
--- form modules use a "window" icon, source code modules
a "lines inside
parentheses" icon, and so on. In addition, the main-form of the
project uses a window icon that appears to be moving fast, alluding to
the fact that this is the form that is initially "run" by
the <a href="run-menu.htm#run-project">Run | Run Project</a> command (assuming that
the default <a href="../operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a>
function is used). In the illustration above, doodler, cycloid,
coefficient-dialog, and background-palette are all form modules, and
doodler is the main form. Util, cycloid, and colorx are source code
modules. There are no shared library, sub-project, or distributed-file
modules illustrated.
</p>
<p id="16">
A form module contains a .bil file that is automatically generated to
provide the <a href="../operators/ide/finder-function.htm"><b>finder-function</b></a> and <a href="../operators/ide/maker-function.htm"><b>maker-function</b></a> for
creating the running window of an interactively designed form window,
plus (sometimes) a .bml file to hold pixmap data (only when widgets on
the form use any pixmaps), and a .cl file that is set up automatically
for you to fill in custom event-handler source code and other code
associated with the window. A source code module simply contains a
single arbitrary source code file. A sub-project module points to the
.lpr project definition file of another project that is always used by
this project. A shared library module contains a DLL file (on Windows)
into which the project can make foreign-function calls. A distributed
file module is an arbitrary file that should be distributed with your
application; the <a href="file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> command simply copies this file to the
distribution directory along with the runnable files of the project
that it creates. A
distributed directory module is a directory that will be copied along
with its entire contents into the standalone app's distribution
directory.  An editable file module is a file that is neither compiled
and loaded nor distributed, but which may be shown in the editor from
this list in the project manager, and searched when the Find In Files
dialog searches the current project.
</p>
<h3 id="17">
Adding a Module to the Current Project
</h3>
<p id="18">
To add a module to the current project, press the Project Manager
Dialog's Add File button (identified by a + sign) on the left end of
the Project Manager's toolbar. A dialog appears asking
which type of module you would like to add.
</p>
<p id="19"><img src="../pictures/pro-file-type.jpg"></p>

<p id="20">
The file selection dialog is then shown, initially displaying only
those files whose pathname-types match the requested module
type. Specifically, .cl, .lsp, and .lisp files are shown for a source
code module, .bil files are shown for a form module, .dll files are
shown for a shared library module, .lpr files are shown for a
sub-project module, and all files are shown for a distributed file
module or editable file module, and directories are shown (in a
different dialog) for a distributed directory module. Selecting
a file of the appropriate type will add it to the current project and
list it in the Project Manager.  The
next <a href="file-menu.htm#save-all">File | Save All</a> that is done will then save
the .lpr project definition file to include a reference to the new
module.
</p>
<p id="21">
Note that form modules are typically added by using the <a href="file-menu.htm#new-form">File | New
Form</a> command and then placing widgets onto the form
interactively. But an existing form may still be added with the Add
File button, perhaps a form that was removed from the project at an
earlier time.
</p>
<p id="22">
A quick alternative to using the Project Manager's Add button is to
right-click an editor buffer pane and select "Add File to Project"
from the pop-up menu that appears. If a source code file that you
would like to add to the current project is already open in the editor
workbook, this is faster than reselecting the file in the file dialog
invoked by the Add button.
</p>
<p id="23">
When a module is selected, clicking on the Remove Selection button
(the one displaying a large X) removes the module from the project (if
you confirm). The module's file is not deleted from the filesystem.
</p>
<h3 id="24">
Module Load Order
</h3>
<p id="25">
When a project is opened or loaded in the IDE or run as a standalone
application, the modules are loaded in the top-to-bottom order shown
in this list, after the project definition .lpr file itself is loaded.
If the load order is important, the up and down arrow buttons on the
Project Manager's toolbar may be used to shift modules around in the
load order.  The dialog constrains the order somewhat, however, and a
warning dialog will indicate this fact if you try to move a module out
of the area of the load order where it is allowed. Specifically, all
shared libraries are always loaded first, followed by all
sub-projects, followed by all form modules and source code modules
combined. Distributed files,
distributed directories, and editable files are not loaded at all, but
are always listed last nevertheless.
</p>
<h3 id="26">
Module Names and Locations
</h3>
<p id="27">
Each item in the list shows the name of the module followed by the
pathname of its file in parentheses. (A .cl file is shown for a form
module, and implies the associated .bil and .bml files that have the
same pathname-name.) If the file is in the same directory as the .lpr
project definition file, this path is simply a pathname name and type,
and otherwise it is a full (absolute) pathname --- this reflects the
way the pathnames are stored internally, and therefore means that the
project will still remember where all of its files live if the
developer arbitrarily moves the directory containing the project
definition file (or moves all of the project's files in that directory
as a group) to a new parent directory or filesystem.
</p>
<p id="28">
The name of each module depends on the module type. For source code
modules, shared library modules, and distributed files, the module
name is simply the <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/pathnam0.htm"><b>pathname-name</b></a> of the module's associated file
(the source module <b>util</b> is named by its associated file
<i>util.cl</i>, for example). For a form module, it is
the name of the form window (which may not be the same as the name of
the associated file, although in the illustration, all forms have the
same names as their associated files). For a sub-project module, it is
the name of that project.
</p>

<h3 id="29">
Sub-Projects
</h3>
<p id="30">
If a sub-project module is added to the project, it will initially
appear as a single line in the list of modules.  Its icon will be a
simple dark-blue triangle arrow pointing to the right.  Unlike the
icons for other types of modules, which are simply visual indicators,
you can click on the arrow icon of a sub-project module to reveal all
of its modules as an indented sublist.  (Alternately, select the item
for the module and press the right-arrow key, as usual with an outline
widget.)  Sub-projects can have their own sub-projects in turn, all of
which can be shown in the module list as a tree.  A project will
remember which subtrees were currently visible when you last saved it,
and restore the same visible part of the tree the next time you open
the project.
</p>
<p id="31">
The modules of a sub-project may then be accessed from the Project
Manager and edited in the same way as modules of the current project
itself.  If you modify a sub-project, such as by changing the order of
modules within a sub-project, the <a href="file-menu.htm#save-all">File | Save All</a> command will
know to regenerate the .lpr file of the subproject just as it does for
the current project.
</p>
<p id="32">
If you would like to open a sub-project as the current project, a
quick way to do that is to right-click the item for the sub-project
and select the <b>Open Selected Project</b> command from the pop-up
menu that appears.
</p>

<h3 id="33">
Renaming and Moving Modules
</h3>
<p id="34">
It may not be apparent how to rename various modules or to move their
files to new locations, and in fact this depends on the type of
module. To rename or move a source code module, select the module in
the list and press the View Selected Code button to edit the source
code file. Then (in the editor) use the <a href="file-menu.htm#save-as">File | Save As</a> command to save
the file to a different pathname. The Project Manager will
automatically update to display the new pathname, and the next <a href="file-menu.htm#save-all">File | Save
All</a> that is done will save the .lpr project definition file
so that it points to the new pathname of that module's file. To rename
a form module, double-click the form to display it in the inspector,
and then change the "name" property in the inspector.  Again, the
Project Manager will update to display the new module name, and the
next Save All will update everything on disk.  As with source code
modules, the <a href="file-menu.htm#save-as">File | Save As</a> command may be used while a form
window is selected to save the form to a new pathname. To move a
shared library or distributed-file module (or to rename its file), you
need to move the file to a new pathname, then remove it from the
project (or vice versa), and then add it back to the project at its
new pathname (this technique could actually be used for any module
type). To rename a sub-project module, you would need to open that
project, change its name, and save it, and then re-open this project.
</p>
<h3 id="35">
Renaming and Moving the Current Project
</h3>
<p id="36">
To change the name of the current project itself, use the Name widget
on the <a href="project-manager-dialog-options.htm">Options</a> tab. When the
modal dialog that then appears asks whether to also rename the
<i>.lpr</i> project definition file to match the new
project name, then the <i>.lpr</i> file will be renamed
if you answer Yes.  (This dialog will not appear for a new project
that has never yet been saved.)  This is recommended to keep things
simple, but is not necessary. The <i>.lpr</i> file could
also be renamed in the OS file manager if the project is not open in
the IDE at the time, though the <a href="recent-menu.htm">Recent menu</a> would then not find the
project where it remembered it to be.
</p>
<p id="37">
To move the entire project to a
different directory, either move the directory itself or move all of
the project's files that are in the directory to a new parent directory,
then re-open the project from its new location.
</p>

<h3 id="38">
Shortcuts in the Module List
</h3>

<p id="39">
Right-clicking in the list of modules shows a shortcut menu of
commands that are generally the toolbar button commands.  This menu
also shows the keyboard shortcuts for the commands.  Pressing the
spacebar will also show this menu.  Pressing the Enter key will invoke
the <b>Edit Source Code</b> button, while double-clicking a module
will invoke the <b>Edit Dialog Form</b> button (or else edit source
code for a non-form module).
</p>

<a href="project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager Dialog</a> for
