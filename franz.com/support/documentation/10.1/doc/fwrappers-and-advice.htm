This document describes the new fwrap (Function WRAPper) facility.
Fwrappers are intended to replace the advice facility, which is still
supported and also documented here. Both facilities allow runtime
modification of defined functions without actually redefining the
function.

</p><hr><hr><h2 id="6"><a name="fwrap-intro-1">1.0 The Fwrap Facility</a></h2>

<p id="7">
The Fwrap facility is provided, starting in release 6.0, to better
implement encapsulation, tracing, and advice functionalities.
Highlights of the Fwrap facility include:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="8">A new function wrapping facility.</li> 
<li id="9">The older, advice
encapsulation facility is deprecated. It still exists in autoloadable
form and works, but might not remain in future versions.
</li>
<li id="10">
The trace macro is re-implemented to use the fwrap facility, instead
of the encapsulation facility.
</li>
<li id="11">
The macro, <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a>,
allows new function wrappers to be created in a lisp-like style,
incorporating the use of environments, pre-compilation, and argument
identification, in a manner similar to other defining macros such as
defun and defmacro. This is in contrast to the forms-based approach of
<a href="operators/excl/defadvice.htm"><b>defadvice</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="12">
The advise/advice facility is deprecated. It still exists in
autoloadable form and works, but might not remain in future
versions. The user is encouraged to switch to the fwrap facility in
creating and manipulating advice-like functionality.
</li>
</ul>

<hr><h2 id="13"><a name="fwrap-background-2">1.1 Background</a></h2>

<p id="14">
The encapsulation facility, as manifested in previous versions of
Allegro CL in the advice and trace facilities, has a major drawback,
in that the act of encapsulationg a function produces a new, non-eq
function object that is installed at the point of the function spec.
</p>
<p id="15">
This means that for example if #'foo were encapsulated, but had been
previously captured and stored in a variable to be later funcalled,
the funcalled function does not execute the encapsulating
functionality. In practical terms, it means that it is impossible to
trace a function object by anything other than its name, and it is
thus also impossible to trace a function which cannot be accessed
via a function spec (usually a symbol, but possibly a list; see
def-function-spec-handler). Also, an internal function such as
#'(flet foo bar) which is traced does not retain its trace status
when the parent function (i.e. #'foo, in this case) is redefined
either by defun, compile, or loading a compiled file.
</p>
<p id="16">
Another major problem with encapsulations is that it is forms-based,
and so acts in the dynamic environment only, while fwrappers operate
in the lexical environment. One of the differences is internal, and
affects performance rather than coding: to use advice, the argument
list must be created so the advice can operate on it. The fwrap
facility may not need the arguments list, and if it does not, it will
not be created, saving execution time. Further, the arguments are
known to advice only from the list: you cannot refer to arguments by
name, only by position, and if optional or keywords arguments are
defaulted, advice will not know the value (except perhaps by calling
the excl:arglist function). Fwrappers can refer to arguments by name
because they can be defined with the argument list specified.
</p>
<p id="17">
Advice also defines the code that does the work and what this code is
applied to at once. there is no way to define advice and apply it
later to a function. Fwappers can be defined independently of what
they might modify (with <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a>) and then apply it to a function
(with <a href="operators/excl/fwrap.htm"><b>fwrap</b></a>) when and only
when desired. Fwrapper objects survive dumplisp and can be applied
when an image is started.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="18"><a name="fwrap-description-1">2.0 The Def-fwrapper/fwrap Facility</a></h2>

<p id="19">
The term "fwrapper" means "function wrapper". A normal function
that implements any functionality is called a primary function
for the purposes of this description. An fwrapper, then, is a
function that "wraps" the primary function, i.e. it executes 
at the point of call to the primary function, but its functionality
surrounds the call to the actual primary function call, in a similar
way that around methods surround the primary method in CLOS. Several
fwrappers may wrap a primary function; they are executed in an
outer-to-inner order that can be manipulated.
</p>
<p id="20">
During the time of the execution of fwrapped functions, an attempt
is made to preserve the argument list without reproducing it,
if possible, in order to reduce consing and maintain speed. The
conceptual arglist starts out as a stack pointer and a
number-of-arguments variable, and is only converted to a list
if any one of the fwrappers in the line forces the argument list
to list form. Once an argument-list is made into a list, it remains
a list until the primary function is called, when it is re-expanded
on the stack.
</p>
<p id="21">
You create an fwrapper object with the <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a> macro. This macro associates an
fwrapper object with a name (a function spec, which is typically
a symbol but can be a list), but that name does not name a function or
function object and nothing is wrapped with a call to <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a>. You wrap a function
independently with a call to <a href="operators/excl/fwrap.htm"><b>fwrap</b></a>. The function being wrapped is called the
<i>primary function</i>.
</p>
<p id="22">
The fwrapper object can be compiled, just like any operator, with
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile.htm"><b>compile</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="23">
As we said above, fwrappers wrap around their primary functions and a
wrapper must call <a href="operators/excl/call-next-fwrapper.htm"><b>call-next-fwrapper</b></a> in order that the primary
function (or the next inner wrapper) be called. The return values from
the primary function (or the next inner wrapper) are returned from the
call to <a href="operators/excl/call-next-fwrapper.htm"><b>call-next-fwrapper</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="24">
Consider the following simple example.
</p>
<pre id="25">
;; We define Function bar, which prints a message
;; saying bar has been called and what its argument was.
user(39): (defun bar (x)
               (format t &quot;Function bar called with argument ~S.~%&quot; x))

               (format t &quot;This form in bar-wrap called!~%&quot;))
bar-wrap

;; bar is not yet wrapped, so it is unaffected:
user(41): (bar 10)
Function bar called with argument 10.
nil

;; Now we wrap bar with bar-wrap. barwrapper1 is a symbol
;; which serves as the identifier (called the indicator)
;; of this wrapper of bar.

;; We call bar with a non-integer argument. The conditional

<li id="27"><b>Order of fwrappers.</b>

<p id="35">
<a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a> has been designed to
work well as a Common Lisp defining form. As a macro, it can be
macroexpanded, thus revealing portions of the implementation of the
definition it is creating.  Because it uses the same techniques as
defun and defmacro to create a definition, compilation of a form is
efficient in resource-usage, and loading a .fasl file with a compiled
def-fwrapper form does not require the compiler to be present, as is
the case with compiled defadvice forms.
</p>
<p id="36">
To find out what a <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a> form is doing, it is
recommended to use a standard macroexpansion technique:
</p>
<pre id="37">
(pprint (macroexpand '(def-fwrapper foo-wrap ...)))
</pre>
<p id="38">
which will reveal the implementation of foo-wrap.
</p>
<p id="39">
To use an fwrapper that is compiled, without requiring the compiler
in the image, simply place the def-fwrapper form into a source
file, compile the file in a lisp with a compiler, and load the
resulting fasl file into a lisp (not necessarily containing a
compiler). The fwrapper will then be defined as a compiled
function, and fwrap may then be used to fwrap the primary function.

<hr><hr><h2 id="52"><a name="trace-modifications-1">4.0 Modifications Made to Trace</a></h2>

<p id="53">
The only change that has been made to the trace interface is the
addition of the :not-inside trace option. It is similar to the
:inside option, in that it checks whether or not the specified
function is active when the traced function is entered.  However,
it requires that the specified function not be on the stack.
Both :inside and :not-inside work together and check simultaneously,
for maximum efficiency.
</p>
<p id="54">
Other changes that are not functional are mostly bug fixes and
enhancements to the operation of trace:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="55">The :inside (and :not-inside) options operate on the traced
function's thread to find functions, rather than to setup
statefulness to determine that a function has been entered.
This fixes a bug where if (trace ((foo :inside bar))) is specified,
and bar is entered on one thread and foo is then entered on another,
foo was being traced.
</li>
<li id="56">Under some circumstances after a :break-after point was hit, no
tracing could work anymore until that break loop was returned from.
</li>
<li id="57">Redefining functions that had traced internal functions
(flets/labels) tended to forget about the fact that they had
been traced.
</li>
<li id="58">Generic-functions lost their genericity when traced.  This caused
things like compute-applicable-methods and others to fail on traced
gfs.</li>

<p id="60">
We recommend that you replace any advice code you might have with
fwrapper code (though advice is still supported). This section
indicates how such code might be rewritten.
</p>

<p id="61">
Things to note:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="62">
<b>You must insert a (call-next-fwrapper) if you want the wrapped
function to run.</b> With before and after advice, the advised
function ran automatically, after the before advice and before the
after advice. Only around advice needed an indication of where the
advised function was to be run. Fwrappers are like around advice in
this respect: the function (and also inner fwrappers) will only run
when <a href="operators/excl/call-next-fwrapper.htm"><b>call-next-fwrapper</b></a> is
called (it takes no arguments).
</li>
<li id="63">
<b>Fwrappers must be defined and applied.</b> Advice is defined and
applied to the advised function in one operation. With fwrappers, the
definition and the application are separate actions. Define an
fwrapper with <a href="operators/excl/def-fwrapper.htm"><b>def-fwrapper</b></a>
and applied with <a href="operators/excl/fwrap.htm"><b>fwrap</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="64">
<b>Positioning is more complicated.</b> Advice could be positioned
using an argument to <a href="operators/excl/advise.htm"><b>advise</b></a>. Fwrappers are always positioned by
<a href="operators/excl/fwrap.htm"><b>fwrap</b></a> in the outermost
position. If you wish to rearrange fwrappers, you must use <a href="operators/excl/fwrap-order.htm"><b>fwrap-order</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="65"><b>Each fwrapper must be removed individually.</b> The <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> macro could remove many
pieces of advice (called with no arguments, it removed all advise from
everything). <a href="operators/excl/funwrap.htm"><b>funwrap</b></a> removes
only the single fwrapper specified by the
<i>indicator</i>.

advice and advising functions from the release 5.0.1 and earlier
documentation.
</p>
<p id="70">
The advice facility allows you to affect the action of
a function by adding code before, around or after the evaluation of
forms defining a function. You may do this with interpreted or
compiled functions without changing the source code or having to
recompile. This facility is particularly useful in cases where you
have compiled code but do not have access to the source code (for
example, in a commercial application). </p>

<p id="71">Advice works on macros as well as functions but what gets advised
is the macro-expander function, not the forms returned by the macro
expansion. Thus, advising a macro is more complex than advising a
function and there are fewer situations where advising a macro is
helpful. <a href="#advising-macros-2">Section 6.5 Advising macros</a> below
describes how to advise a macro. The remainder of this document
describes advising functions only. </p>

<p id="72">Note that you cannot advise special forms, such as <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setq.htm"><b>setq</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/progn.htm"><b>progn</b></a>, and that some standard Common Lisp
functions that are normally compiled in-line, for example <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/carcdrca.htm"><b>car</b></a>, will not run advice code when
compiled. (Since many Common Lisp functions may be compiled in-line,
care should be used when advising such functions, since advice will
not be run if a function is compiled inline. Compiling: Help with
declarations describes how to get information during the code
generation phase of compilation.) </p>

<p id="73">To get the nomenclature straight: </p>

<ul>
<li id="74">
<i><b>advice</b></i> is attached to a function;
</li>
<li id="75">
the act of attaching advice to functions is <em>advising</em> them;
</li>
<li id="76">
the code that implements the advice is <em>advice code</em>.
</li>
<li id="77">
This document describes the <em>advice facility</em>.
</li>
<li id="78">
You use either the advice facility or advice when advising functions. 
</li>
</ul>

<p id="79">The functions for the advice facility are in the
<code>trace</code> module, which may not be
included with the default Lisp image file. If you wish to use advice,
the module must be loaded. It will be autoloaded with the first call
to most advice functions, but you can load it explicitly, for example
by evaluating the following form: </p>

<pre id="80">
(require :trace) 
</pre>


<p id="81">If you commonly use advice, you may want to put such a form in your
<i>.clinit.cl</i> file. </p>

<p id="82">Advising a function has a number of uses: </p>

<ol>

  <li id="83">To put debugging information in a function for testing (checking
    arguments and return values, for example). Doing so is useful
    particularly since advice code can be very easily removed (with a
    call to <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a>). 
    Note that advice code is evaluated each
    time a function is called, so you may wish to avoid doing output
    in advice code in a recursive function. </li>

  <li id="84">To add extra argument checking or conditioning to an already
    written function without modifying the function itself. </li>

  <li id="85">To modify code provided by others where you do not have access
    to the source (and therefore cannot modify the code
    directly). </li>

</ol>

<p id="86">If a function which has been advised (that is: advice code is
attached to it) is redefined with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/defun.htm"><b>defun</b></a>, either at the top level or by loading a
new definition from a file, the function will still have the same
advice. The advice will be removed only with a call to <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> or a related function. </p>

<p id="87">Advice code can access the list of arguments passed to the advised
function, which is bound to the variable excl:arglist, and the list of
returned values, which is bound to the Lisp variable values. The
advice code may look at and change either the argument list or the
list of returned values. (Which values can be modified depends on the
type of advice.  :before and :around advice may change the argument
list, but the list bound to values is not formed until all :around
advice has been evaluated. :after advice has access to values, but,
since the advised function has already run, the argument list is of
little interest to :after advice.) If you change either list, be
careful to ensure that you preserve such structure as is
necessary. For example, if you replace the argument list, you must be
sure the new list has as least as many elements as there are required
arguments to the advised function. </p>

<p id="88">There are five functions for advising and unadvising: </p>

<p id="89"><a href="operators/excl/advise.htm"><b>advise</b></a></p>
<p id="90"><a href="operators/excl/advise-1.htm"><b>advise-1</b></a></p>
<p id="91"><a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a></p>
<p id="92"><a href="operators/excl/unadvise-1.htm"><b>unadvise-1</b></a></p>
<p id="93"><a href="operators/excl/defadvice.htm"><b>defadvice</b></a></p>

<p id="94">The following functions and global variable are also useful: </p>

<p id="95"><a href="operators/excl/advised-functions.htm"><b>advised-functions</b></a></p>
<p id="96"><a href="operators/excl/compile-advice.htm"><b>compile-advice</b></a></p>
<p id="97"><a href="operators/excl/describe-advice.htm"><b>describe-advice</b></a></p>
<p id="98"><a href="variables/excl/s_compile-advice_s.htm"><code>*compile-advice*</code></a></p>


<p id="99"><a href="operators/excl/advise.htm"><b>advise</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> are macros, <a href="operators/excl/advise-1.htm"><b>advise-1</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/unadvise-1.htm"><b>unadvise-1</b></a> are the functions which implement
the macros. The macro <a href="operators/excl/defadvice.htm"><b>defadvice</b></a> allows users to use a defun-like
syntax for advice. </p>


<hr><h2 id="100"><a name="advising-funs-2">6.1 Advising a function</a></h2>

<p id="101">You may advise functions with <a href="operators/excl/advise.htm"><b>advise</b></a>, <a href="operators/excl/advise-1.htm"><b>advise-1</b></a> or <a href="operators/excl/defadvice.htm"><b>defadvice</b></a>. advise and advise-1 take as
arguments the name of the function being advised, the class, described
next, the position (relative to other advice, see 
<a href="#position-more-3">below</a>), 
the name given to the piece of
advice being added, and the forms to run when the function is
called. Advice comes in three types, called the class of advice. These
are <a href="#advice-class-before-3">:before</a>, 
<a href="#advice-class-around-3">:around</a>, 
and <a href="#advice-class-after-3">:after</a>. 
Let us look more closely at the classes of
advice and at the possible values for the position argument. </p>

<hr><h2 id="102"><a name="advice-class-before-3">6.1.1 Advice of class :before</a></h2>

<p id="103">:before advice will be evaluated before the function call. The
argument list with which the function was called is available to
:before advice. The argument list is stored as the value of the
variable excl:arglist. You may check the values in this list, change
the values or replace the list altogether with a new list. (If you
replace the list, be careful that it have the correct format for the
function (number and types of arguments in the list) or you may get an
error, or worse, a wrong result but no error.) :before advice is used
only for its side effects. Any value returned by :before advice code
is ignored. </p>



<hr><h2 id="104"><a name="advice-class-around-3">6.1.2 Advice of class :around</a></h2>

<p id="105">:around advice places the function call inside the code of the
advice. The keyword <code>:do-it</code> signals where the
function should be called within the advice code. When Lisp encounters
the <code>:do-it</code>, it calls the next piece of :around advice, if
there is more, or the function. When the function returns, the :around
advice code continues execution. <code>:do-it</code> may appear
several times in <code>:around</code> advice. Normally, it is placed
in conditional code, e.g. </p>

<pre id="106">
(if (zerop (car excl:arglist))(+ 5 :do-it)(* 7 :do-it)) 
</pre>

<p id="107"> In that case, the system will encounter one or the other
<code>:do-it</code>, but not both. However, it is allowed to have
several <code>:do-it</code>'s, all of which are evaluated. In that
case, the succeeding :around advice and the advised function are
evaluated more than once. :after advice is still evaluated only once,
however. :around advice can work with <code>excl:arglist</code> before
the <code>:do-it</code>. Since the advised function is run at the
location specified by the <code>:do-it</code>, the values the function
return are available to <code>:around</code> advice just like with any
function call. The list bound to the variable values is not set up
until after all <code>:around</code> advice is run, then values is
bound to the list of values returned by the final piece of :around
advice. Note that if the function returns multiple values, these
should be caught with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/multiple.htm"><b>multiple-value-bind</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/multipl1.htm"><b>multiple-value-list</b></a> or some similar function if
you are interested in the values beyond the first. </p>



<hr><h2 id="108"><a name="advice-class-after-3">6.1.3 Advice of class :after</a></h2>

<p id="109"><code>:after</code> advice is evaluated after the function has
completed, but before control is passed back to whatever called the
function. <code>:after</code> advice may examine and change the list
of returned values from the last piece of <code>:around</code> advice
(or the function, if there is no :around advice) stored in the
variable values. <code>:after</code> advice is used only for its side
effects. Any value returned by the <code>:after</code> advice code is
ignored. The list bound to values is returned from the now completed
function call. </p>



<hr><h2 id="110"><a name="position-more-3">6.1.4 More on the position argument</a></h2>

<p id="111">Let us look at the position argument more closely. As we said
above, advice is numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, if there are n pieces of
advice of a given class. Advice with a smaller index is run farther
from the function call than advice with a larger index. Regardless of
what position was specified for advice when it was defined, its real
position is the number in the list from 0 to n-1. A new piece of
advice of the same class will be placed according to its position
argument. If that argument is a number, that number is placed with
respect to the list 0, ..., n-1. The argument can also be a name of
other advice, in which case it is placed immediately farther from the
function call than that named advice.  Or the argument can be <code>nil</code>, in which case the advice is placed farthest from
the function call. Here are some examples. Let us assume that the
function foo has no :before advice on it when we start. We will define
advice, and show after each definition the order in which the advice
will be run.
</p>

<pre id="112">
(defun foo (&rest args) nil)

(excl:advise foo :before
  john 10 (format t "hello john")) 
</pre>

<p id="113">Things will be run in the following order: </p>

<pre id="114">
john foo 
</pre>

<pre id="115">
(excl:advise foo :before
  cathy 5 (format t "hello cathy")) 
</pre>

<p id="116">Things will be run in the following order: </p>

<pre id="117">
john cathy foo 
</pre>







<hr><h2 id="118"><a name="removing-advice-2">6.2 Removing advice from a function or macro</a></h2> 

<p id="119">The <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> macro and
the <a href="operators/excl/unadvise-1.htm"><b>unadvise-1</b></a> function are
used to remove advice from functions or macros. Note that <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> called without arguments
removes all advice from all functions and macros. </p>

<p id="120">Let us look at some examples of unadvising functions. Note
particularly how the value <code>nil</code> for the

interpreted. </p>

<hr><h2 id="135"><a name="advice-utilities-2">6.3 Utilities associated with advice</a></h2>


<p id="136">The following functions and variables are useful when using the advice facility. </p>


  <p id="137"><a href="operators/excl/advised-functions.htm"><b>advised-functions</b></a>,
  a function, returns a list of all advice on all advised functions.</p>
  <p id="138"><a href="variables/excl/s_compile-advice_s.htm"><code>*compile-advice*</code></a>, a
  variable, if true, causes newly added advice to be compiled automatically. If <code>nil</code>,
  newly added advice is left uncompiled (advice can be compiled with <a href="operators/excl/compile-advice.htm"><b>compile-advice</b></a>).</p>
  <p id="139"><a href="operators/excl/compile-advice.htm"><b>compile-advice</b></a>, a

  <p id="140"><a href="operators/excl/describe-advice.htm"><b>describe-advice</b></a>, a
  function, prints a description of advice on the function named by the required argument to
  the stream named by the optional argument (which defaults to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/debug-io.htm"><code>*standard-output*</code></a>).</p>



<hr><h2 id="141"><a name="advice-examples-2">6.4 Examples using advice</a></h2>

<p id="142">In the following example, we define a function and then add advice
code which checks and (if necessary) modifies the arguments, signals
an error for wrong arguments, and takes care of special cases not
actually handled by the function itself. We do not suggest that the
following example represents good programming style or that using
advice is preferable to actually rewriting the original function. The
example is designed only to show how advice works. We apply advice
using excl:advise, excl:advise-1, and excl:defadvice.</p>

<p id="143">Consider the following function, which calculates both the number
of permutations of n things taken k at a time and the number of
combinations of n things taken k at a time, returning both as multiple
values.</p>

<pre id="144">
(defun perm-and-comb (n k)
  (let ((perm (/ (fact n) (fact (- n k)))))
    (values perm (/ perm (fact k)))))

(defun fact (n)
  (if (= n 1) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))
</pre>

<p id="145">There are several things to notice about perm-and-comb. One is that
if you put the arguments in the wrong order (i.e. if the first
argument is less than or equal to the second) or if either argument is
not an integer, the function goes into an infinite loop.  The first
pieces of :before advice check that the arguments are in the right
order.</p>

<pre id="146">
(excl:advise perm-and-comb :before order nil
  (let ((n (car excl:arglist)) (k (cadr excl:arglist)))
    (if (&gt;= k n) (setq excl:arglist (list k n)))))
</pre>

<p id="147">The next piece of advice checks that the arguments are integers,
truncating them if they are not. </p>

<pre id="148">
(excl:advise perm-and-comb :before truncate nil
  (let ((n (car excl:arglist)) (k (cadr excl:arglist)))
    (if (not (integerp n))
        (setf (car excl:arglist) (truncate n)))
    (if (not (integerp k))
        (setf (cadr excl:arglist) (truncate k)))))
</pre>

<p id="149">(We are not suggesting that it is good programming style to change
arguments without warning or notice. Generally, that is a bad idea.)
</p>

<p id="150">All the cases where numeric arguments to perm-and-comb cause an
infinite loop have not yet been covered. The following :around advice
completely checks the arguments (assuming that they are numbers),
causing a fatal error if the arguments will cause an infinite
loop. Some of the checks are redundant, of course, given the :before
advice already applied to perm-and-comb. </p>

<pre id="151">
(excl:defadvice perm-and-comb (error :around)
  (let ((n (car excl:arglist)) (k (cadr excl:arglist)))
    (if (or (not (integerp n)) (not (integerp k))
            (&gt;= k n) (&gt; 1 k))
        (error &quot;Improper arguments to comb-and-perm: ~D ~D&quot; n k)
        :do-it)))
</pre>

<p id="152">Now one last change. The form (perm-and-comb 10 0) will generate an
error (and, indeed will cause an infinite loop, since (fact 0) will
not stop), but the number of permutations and the number of
combinations of 10 things taken none at a time is in fact defined.
(There is only one way: choose nothing.) Let us add one final piece of
:around advice, which will return 1 and 1 when the argument k is
0. This advice must run before the error advice defined above, since
the argument k being 0 will cause a fatal error if the error advice
sees it. By specifying a position of error, we guarantee that this new
advice is placed farther from the actual function call than the error
advice. Note too that the forms argument is contained in a list. </p>

<pre id="153">
(excl:advise-1 'perm-and-comb :around 'zerotest 'error
  '((let ((k (cadr excl:arglist)))
      (if (zerop k) (return (values 1 1)) :do-it))))
</pre>

<p id="154">Notice the use of return. Since we know the answer, there is no
reason to call the function. </p>

<p id="155">For the final example, let us suppose that you are actually
interested in the number of permutations and the ratio of permutations
to combinations. Here is :after advice that will change the returned
values to be what you want. The first returned value is left alone and
the second is replaced by the ratio of the first and the original
second. </p>

<pre id="156">
(excl:advise perm-and-comb :after nil nil
  (let ((p (car values)) (c (cadr values)))
    (setq values (list p (/ p c)))))
</pre>

<p id="157">Note that if the :around advice named zerotest returns without
calling perm-and-comb, this <code>:after</code> advice will not be
run. In this case, that is okay, since the values returned by
<b>zerotest</b> would not be changed by the
<code>:after</code> advice. However, it is important to keep in mind
all of the advice on a particular function to ensure that different
pieces are not working at cross purposes. The function <a href="operators/excl/describe-advice.htm"><b>describe-advice</b></a>, defined above, is
useful for that purpose. When all of the advice given above has been
attached to <b>perm-and-comb</b>, <a href="operators/excl/describe-advice.htm"><b>describe-advice</b></a> prints the
following. </p>

<hr><h2 id="159"><a name="advising-macros-2">6.5 Advising macros</a></h2>

<p id="160">You may advise macros as well as functions but note that both what
is being advised and where the advice is run is very different when a
macro is advised than when a function is advised. When you advise a
macro, you advise the macro expansion function. This function takes
two arguments, the whole form and the environment. The macro name will
be the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/carcdrca.htm"><b>car</b></a> of the form
argument. The advice will thus be run at macro expansion time. Macros
are typically advised for purposes of source-file recording, tracing,
and other informational purposes. If you advise macros in order to
affect their behavior (in ways other than simply printing or storing
information) you must be very careful not to break or confuse the
macro expansion system.</p>

<p id="161">The effect and behavior of advice applied to macros (and placed on
the macro expansion function) is the same as that described above for
functions. Therefore, <em>name</em>, <em>position</em>, and
<em>class</em> are all interpreted the same way and the advice is
removed with <a href="operators/excl/unadvise.htm"><b>unadvise</b></a> (or
<a href="operators/excl/unadvise-1.htm"><b>unadvise-1</b></a>) just as with
functions. </p>

<p id="162">Here is a simple example. We define the macro
<b>safe-car</b>. Then we advise it to print a
message whenever it is expanded. </p>

<pre id="163">
USER(25): (defmacro safe-car (x)
            (let ((object (gensym)))
               `(let ((,object ,x))
