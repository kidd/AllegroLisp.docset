<p id="5">
This document provides the release notes for
release 10.1
of Allegro Common Lisp and related products. Many sections are divided
into non-backward-compatible changes (that produce different behavior
in release 10.1 compared to 
release
10.0) 
and changes
unrelated to backward-compatibility. Note that a bug fix is <i>not</i>
considered a backward-incompatible change even if it does result in
changed behavior because the previous behavior was erroneous.
</p>




<p id="6">
You may wish to look at the 10.0 Release Notes, included in
this distribution as the file
<a href="version-100-release-notes.htm">version-100-release-notes.htm</a>.
</p>

<p id="7">
This document describes the changes, major and minor,
from 10.0
to 10.1. Please look particularly at these
sections:
</p>

<ul>

<li id="8">
<a href="#acl-new">Section 6.1 New features in the base Lisp</a>: this section describes new
features.
</li>
<li id="9">
<a href="#acl-non-back-2">Section 6.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in the base Lisp</a>: this very important
section describes changes to Allegro CL which are <b>not</b> backward
compatible. You may have to modify your source code in light of these
changes.
</li>
<li id="10">

<a href="#cg-non-back-2">Section 8.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in Common Graphics</a>: [Common Graphics is not
available on all platforms] this section describes changes to Common
Graphics which are <b>not</b> backward compatible. You may have to

</li>






<li id="11">
<a href="#post101-info-1">Section 2.0 Information on changes and new stuff since the 10.1 release</a>: this section describes
material added after the initial Allegro CL 10.1 release, along with
other post-10.1 changes. 
</li>


</ul>

<p id="12">
If you notice changed or unexpected behavior with an operator,
variable, class, or facility, search for its name in this document to
see whether there is an entry concerning it.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="13"><a name="post101-info-1">2.0 Information on changes and new stuff since the 10.1 release</a></h2>

<p id="14">
The following changes have been implemented by patches and/or updates
since the initial release of Allegro CL 10.1. See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> for
information on getting patches and updates.
</p>
<p id="15">
This section is included in the versions 10.0 and 9.0 updated release
notes because some updates are retrofitted to those earlier
releases. Each change says whether it applies to releases prior to
version 10.1.
</p>

<ol>
<li id="16">
<b>New macro mp:do-periodically.</b> The new macro <a href="operators/mp/do-periodically.htm"><b>mp:do-periodically</b></a> alternates executing a body
of code with sleeping a specified amount of time, all within a
non-returning loop (you can break out of the loop by calling
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/return.htm"><b>return</b></a>). While coding
such a loop is easy, a hand-coded one may cons excessively
while <a href="operators/mp/do-periodically.htm"><b>mp:do-periodically</b></a> is
tailored to cons hardly at all. See the description
of <a href="operators/mp/do-periodically.htm"><b>mp:do-periodically</b></a> for more
information. <b>This change applies to releases 9.0, 10.0 and 10.1.</b>
</li>
</ol>

<hr><hr><h2 id="17"><a name="fasl-incompat-1">3.0 Fasl files are not-compatible between versions and operating systems</a></h2>













<hr><h2 id="18"><a name="version-fasl-incompat-2">3.1 All pre-10.1 Lisp compiled files must be recompiled (old fasl files will not load)</a></h2>

<p id="19">
<i>fasl</i> files (compiled Lisp files) created by
releases of Allegro CL prior to 10.1 will not load
into Allegro CL 10.1. All such files must be
recreated by compiling the associated Lisp source files. An error will
be signaled if Lisp attempts to load an older, incompatible
<i>fasl</i> file.
</p>





<hr><h2 id="20"><a name="os-fasl-incompat-2">3.2 Fasl files may be incompatible in different Lisps on same hardware</a></h2>

<h3 id="21">
Fasl files created on Windows x86 cannot be loaded into Linux or
FreeBSD x86 Lisps
</h3>

<p id="22">
The Windows and UNIX operating systems are too different. However,
FASL files (for the same Lisp version) can generally be shared between
different UNIX operating systems on the same hardware. The general
principles are as follows. Note that incompatibility may creep in for
reasons outside our control. If fasl files are incompatible, recompile
on the target machine.
</p>
<h3 id="23">
Fasl files will usually be compatible between platforms when:
</h3>
<ul>
<li id="24">
the architecture (hardware) is the same
</li>
<li id="25">
the calling convention is the same (that is, the method of calling
functions and the registers they use for arguments are the same)
</li>
<li id="26">
the method for generating signals can be made compatible (this cannot
be done for Windows and UNIX, so they are incompatible for this
reason)
</li>
</ul>
<p id="27">
It is up to the user to ensure that there are no os-specific
dependencies, or that features (i.e. #+/#- ) did not cause
essential code to be excluded or extraneous code introduced
that would cause a problem on the crossed architecture.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="28"><a name="install-1">4.0 Release Notes for installation</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="29">




<b>Version 10.1 uses the 10.0 installation
procedure</b>:
Installation is described in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>. 


</li>
<li id="30">
<b>The distribution includes 8 bit and 16 bit character images</b>
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). Allegro CL
has images that support 8 bit characters only, or 16 bit
characters only. It is our expectation that most users will use the 16
bit images. Executables supplied with the distribution either have or
do not have `8' in the name. Those with 8 in the name (mlisp8 and
alisp8, e.g.) support 8 bit characters. Those without a number in the
name support 16 bit characters. Image (dxl) files also come in 8 and
16 varieties. Again, 8 in the name means 8 bit character
support. Character support for images and executables must
match. Trying to start an executable with the wrong type of image
fails.
</li>

<li id="31">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro Composer images in the distribution</b> 
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To
create an Allegro Composer image, start Allegro CL and load
<em>buildcomposer.cl</em>. That will produce <em>composer</em> and
<em>composer.dxl</em>, or <em>composer8</em> and
<em>composer8.dxl</em>. Allegro Composer is available on Unix only.
</li>

<li id="32">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro CLIM images in the distribution</b> (this
information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To create a CLIM
image, start Allegro CL and load <em>buildclim.cl</em>. That will
produce <em>clim</em> and <em>clim.dxl</em>, or <em>clim8</em> and
<em>clim8.dxl</em>.
</li>

</ol>


<hr><hr><h2 id="33"><a name="platform-specific-1">5.0 Release notes for specific platforms</a></h2>


<p id="34">
See <a href="installation.htm#install-sizes-2">Installation sizes and supported Operating
System versions</a> in <a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a> for a list
of supported platforms and minimal Operating System versions.  Allegro
CL is tested with new OS versions as they are released (but not
pre-release or beta versions). In general, Allegro CL can be assumed
to work on newer versions, including those released after Allegro CL
10.1 itself was released.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="35"><a name="openssl-version-2">5.1 Required versions of OpenSSL needed for the :ssl module</a></h2>

<p id="36">
The :ssl module, when loaded, finds the newest installed version of
OpenSSL libraries on your machine and loads
them. See <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a> for information on
how OpenSSL libraries are found and loaded.
</p>
<p id="37">
If you load foreign libraries which themselves use OpenSSL, either in
a development image or in a delivery (application) image, those
libraries must be compatible with the version of OpenSSL used by the
:ssl module. If they are not, the :ssl module cannot be used.
</p>
<p id="38">
The current supported version of OpenSSL is 1.0.1. We understand there
are plans to end support for version 1.0.1 on December 31, 2016. By
that time, support for version 1.0.2 will be available.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="39"><a name="arm-2">5.2 The ARM-64 (aka ARMv8 and Aarch64) platform</a></h2>

<p id="40">
Allegro CL is now available on the ARM-64 platform under some linux
implementations. The ARM-64 is also called the ARM64, the ARMv8, and
the Aarch64
</p>
<p id="41">
The ARM-64 processor
(see the Wikipedia
description <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">here</a>
and the designer
website <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors">here</a>) is
a RISC processor particularly suited to smaller devices.
</p>
<p id="42">
Only 64-bit Allegro CL runs on the ARM-64, with SMP and non-SMP
versions (there is no 32-bit Lisp on the ARM-64). Common Graphics and
the IDE (see <a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>) are supported in the
non-SMP ARM-64 version.
</p>
<p id="43">
Installation on the ARM-64 is similar to installation on other Linux
platforms. See <a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>. See
the <a href="installation.htm#install-sizes-2">Installation sizes and supported Operating
System versions</a> in that document for information on minimal
operating system versions needed by Allegro CL.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="44"><a name="macosx-2">5.3 macOS notes</a></h2>


<p id="45">
Allegro CL 10.1 is only supported on macOS version 10.11 or later.
It is not supported on versions 10.10 or
earlier.
</p>
<p id="46">
Common Graphics and the IDE are now supported on macOS but are not
supported on the SMP version on the Mac.
See <a href="#mac-ide-2">Section 8.5 Common Graphics and the IDE on the Mac</a> for more
information. Both the IDE and CLIM require certain tools (X11, GTK,
Open Motif) which may have to be installed
separately. See <a href="installation.htm#macosx-install-1">Installation on macOS</a>
in <a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a> for details.
</p>


<p id="47">
The Runtime Analyzer (see <a href="runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>)
does not work properly on the 64-bit macOS port (there is no
problem on the 32-bit port).
</p>



<h4 id="48">Building shared libraries on macOS</h4>
<p id="49">
<a href="foreign-functions.htm#ff-on-macosx-1">Building
shared libraries on macOS</a> in
<a href="foreign-functions.htm">foreign-functions.htm</a> describes how to create a
shared library suitable for loading into Allegro CL. We have
determined that the <code>-flat_namespace</code> to the
<b>ld</b> used to create the shared library is necessary, as shown in
the linked section.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="50"><a name="maverick-x11-2">5.3.1 Updating macOS may break X11</a></h2>

<p id="51">
We have had reports that updating macOS may cause X11 to be stop
working properly. The symptom is blank rectangles in Common Graphics
applications (including Gruff). X11 is necessary for the IDE, CLIM,
and Allegro Composer. To fix the problem, install the latest version
of <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>
(available
from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a>) <b>after</b>
updating the macOS.
</p>










<hr><h2 id="52"><a name="heap-start-2">5.4 Heap start locations</a></h2>


<p id="53">
When building large new images, it is often useful to specify Lisp
heap and ACLmalloc heap start locations. See the discussion of the
<i>lisp-heap-start</i> and
<i>aclmalloc-heap-start</i> keyword arguments in <a href="building-images.htm#arguments-without-inherited-defaults-1">Arguments to
build-lisp-image 2: defaults not inherited from the running
image</a> in <a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>. Here are
the initial locations (called `bases') in Allegro CL 10.1 as delivered.
Values are Hexadecimal integers.

<p id="64">
The following items were included by patches in Allegro CL 10.0 (and
some in earlier releases of Allegro CL) after the release of 10.0 and
therefore were not in the original 10.0 documentation. All are part of
10.1 and the 10.1 documentation. Some changes to 10.1 may also be
backported to 10.0 and/or 9.0, and thus added to the release notes for
those products, but those changes are documented in other sections of
this document.

<ol>
<li id="65">
<b>sys:lispval-storage-type has new :stack-allocated

Note that on a non-os-threads Lisp the value may be seen
as <code>:stack-allocated</code> even if it is outside of the

in June, 2016, Allegro CL included the necessary OpenSSL libraries
with its SSL module. This meant that users did not have to obtain
those libraries themselves but it also meant that users could not use
the latest OpenSSL version until the Allegro CL module was
updated. (Note that not all Allegro CL versions support SSL.) With the
patch released in June, 2016, this has changed. OpenSSL libraries
must be installed on all platforms. These will be linked to when the
Allegro CL SSL module is loaded. An error will be signaled if the
needed OpenSSL library files cannot be
found. See <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a> for more infrmation
on the new scheme. Note that some operating systems include OpenSSL
libraries with their standard OS updates. On those platforms (which
include the Mac and some versions of Linux), Allegro CL users will
likely have to take no action: the OpenSSL libraries will be found in
the standard location for the platform. Also, as said above, there is
no change in Windows, where users have always downloaded the OpenSSL
library files, other than the change to the API described
in <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>.

<b>jLinker update</b>: a patch released in April, 2014 made a number
of changes to the jLinker module. There are now several calling
models, including a new calling style where Lisp functions are
generated by analyzing Java jar files or classes.  The names of the
Lisp functions are systematically derived from the Java names and
mimic the overloading style used in Java; in most cases, the Lisp name
is easily deduced from the Java name so that perusing a translation
table is rarely needed.  The correct Java method to call is determined
at run time by comparing the Lisp argument types to Java
signatures. See <a href="jlinker.htm#calling-style-2">Calling Style from Lisp to Java</a>

<ol>
<li id="125">
<b>An SMP Lisp will fail if there is a thread which prevents garbage
collections.</b> In an SMP Lisp, code that runs atomically, with
interrupt checks optimized out, could block the gc indefinitely. This
represents a bug in the Lisp program that cannot be debugged in Lisp.

<hr><h2 id="137"><a name="cg-significant-new-2">8.1 Significant changes in Common Graphics</a></h2>


<p id="138">
Most changes to Common Graphics in Allegro CL 10.1 are bug fixes and
incremental improvements. There is also the following change which
assists in identifying the causes of compiler warnings.
</p>

<ol>
<li id="139">
<b>New tools for identifying code that causes compiler warnings.</b>
The dialog that shows compilation warnings has a new button for
showing one of the functions that has warnings in the editor.  And
when source debugging information was compiled in (see the compiler
switch <a href="variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a>), you
can select an individual warning and then the form inside the function
that triggered the warning will be selected in the editor.  Also, when
a runtime error is signaled for a call in a function whose source code
location is known, the restarts dialog will include a restart for
showing the calling function in the editor, and it will also select
the form for the erroring call if source debug info is present.
<p id="140">
Here is an example of the pop-up window followed by a picture of the
editor. There are two functions whose compilation signaled warnings,
the first because the argument was unused and the other (the third
definition) because an unbound, undeclared variable (y) is used.
</p>
<p id="141"><img src="pictures/compiler-warn-popup.jpg"></p>

<p id="142"><img src="pictures/comp-warn-plus-ed-ex.jpg"></p>

</li>
</ol>




<hr><h2 id="143"><a name="cg-non-back-2">8.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in Common Graphics</a></h2>

<p id="144">
There are no non-backward compatible changes in release 10.1.
</p>






<hr><h2 id="145"><a name="cg-other-2">8.3 Other changes in Common Graphics</a></h2>




<ol>
<li id="146">
<b>New arguments to add-toolbar and remove-toolbar</b>. Additional
optional arguments to <a href="operators/cg/a/add-toolbar.htm"><b>add-toolbar</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/r/remove-toolbar.htm"><b>remove-toolbar</b></a> control whether existing
toolbars and child-windows are rezied (for
<a href="operators/cg/a/add-toolbar.htm"><b>add-toolbar</b></a>) and existing child-windows are resized (for
<a href="operators/cg/r/remove-toolbar.htm"><b>remove-toolbar</b></a>). These
arguments have in fact been present for several releases but not
documented until now.
</li>
<li id="147">
<b>New function monitor-info</b>. The function <a href="operators/cg/m/monitor-info.htm"><b>monitor-info</b></a> returns information about
all the monitors that are present. This function returns a list whose
length is the number of monitors. For Common Graphics on GTK, the
list elements are each a single-element list containing a box
specifting the coordinate range of the monitor. On Windows, the list
elements are four element lists with the same first element and
additional information in the remaining elements.
</li>
<li id="148">
<b>The clipboard on Windows can contain items at custom
locations</b>. See <a href="operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a> for a discussion of clipboard
locations passed as the value of
the (required) <i>clipboard-format</i> 
argument. Examples show how such items can be accessed by the Lisp
application that posted them and by other Lisp applications.
</li>
<li id="149">
On the Mac, the Common Graphics "Alt" is now the Mac's Option/Alt key
rather than the Command key as before.  This is more consistent with
other applications, and reduces conflicts with global Mac keyboard
shortcuts that use the Command key.  If you needed to revert to the
old behavior, you could do so by setting the internal global
variable <code>cg.gtk::*use-option-key-for-alt*</code>
to <code>nil</code>, though we hope that that is not
needed.
</li>
<li id="150">
On the Mac, the Command key (sometimes along with the
Option key) can now be used with the arrow keys to scroll by pages and
to move to the start and end.  This applies to the text-editing
control as well as to widgets that are implemented in Common Graphics
(rather than supplied by the underlying windowing system).  This takes
the place of the PageUp/PageDown/Home/End keys found on other
platforms, when not using something like Emacs that provides the
needed keystrokes.
</li>
</ol>

<hr><h2 id="151"><a name="cg-bug-fixes-3">8.3.1 Miscellaneous bug fixes in Common Graphics</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="152">
Fixed: The function <a href="operators/cg/f/fill-circle.htm"><b>fill-circle</b></a> drew in the wrong place when
<a href="variables/cg/s_antialiasing_s.htm"><code>*antialiasing*</code></a> is true
and the window is scrolled.
</li>
<li id="153">
Fixed: Drawing with a <a href="operators/cg/f/fill-texture.htm"><b>fill-texture</b></a> did not align textures properly
when the window is scrolled.
</li>
<li id="154">
Fixed: Keypresses on non-English keyboards that produced
multi-byte characters were not handled correctly by Common
Graphics. (Patched for 10.0.)
</li>
<li id="155">
Fixed: Common Graphics reversed the behavior of the
commands on the Microsoft Windows right-click pop-up menu on a window
scrollbar to scroll to either the top or the bottom of the window.
(Patched for 10.0.)
</li>
<li id="156">
The file dialog on Windows could crash when no
:default-extension argument is passed. (Patched in 10.0.)
</li>
<li id="157">
Fixed: <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a>'ing
<a href="operators/cg/s/stream-origin.htm"><b>stream-origin</b></a> failed within
<a href="operators/cg/w/with-delayed-redraw.htm"><b>with-delayed-redraw</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="158">
Fixed: in <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>s, keystrokes such as Alt-O to invoke
the "OK" default-button still work while editing text in a grid
cell.
</li>
<li id="159">
Fixed: in <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>s,
hangs could occur when dragging a grid row or column past the end of
its section to cause the section to auto-scroll, especially for a
larger grid that's drawing lots of stuff.
</li>
<li id="160">
Fixed: in <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>s,
when the <a href="operators/cg/e/edit-start-trigger.htm"><b>edit-start-trigger</b></a> of a grid cell is
<code>:get-focus</code>, the text editing will begin whenever
the cell gets the keyboard focus, including when selecting the dialog
that the grid-widget is on or alt-tabbing back to the application.
Previously it required tabbing to the cell or pressing the Enter key.
</li>
<li id="161">
Fixed: on Linux and Mac, configuring a second monitor to
the left of the primary monitor led to improper placement of IDE
windows as well as modal dialogs in applications.
</li>
<li id="162">
Fixed: programmatically moving a top-level window on the
Mac to a different monitor left the window invisible in the Mac's
default mode where it uses a separate "space" for each monitor.  You
will probably still need to turn off that Mission Control option if
you want to turn off the IDE's option to use a single parent window
and then place different IDE windows on different monitors, because
the separate IDE windows are still on a single owner window.  Leaving
the IDE on a secondary monitor and unplugging that monitor and
plugging it back in could still leave the IDE invisible as well unless
you turn off that Mission Control option.
</li>
<li id="163">
Fixed: In generated Common Graphics applications on Mac and Linux,
using the macro <a href="operators/cg/i/in-cg-process.htm"><b>in-cg-process</b></a> could lead to severe
failure due to accidentally causing multiple lisp processes to handle
events from the single GTK event queue.
</li>
<li id="164">
Fixed: on Windows, if <a href="variables/cg/s_antialiasing_s.htm"><code>*antialiasing*</code></a> is true then the
functions <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-to.htm"><b>draw-to</b></a> and
<a href="operators/cg/d/draw-to-x-y.htm"><b>draw-to-x-y</b></a> did not
update the current drawing position.
</li>
<li id="165">
Fixed: on Linux and Mac, the functions
<a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-existing-pathname.htm"><b>ask-user-for-existing-pathname</b></a> and
<a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-new-pathname.htm"><b>ask-user-for-new-pathname</b></a> broke if the
:initial-directory argument is the root directory.
</li>
<li id="166">
Fixed: on Windows, <a href="operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a> can now write and read
back text from multiple "locations" on the system clipboard.
</li>
<li id="167">
Fixed: sometimes a <a href="operators/cg/f/fill-texture.htm"><b>fill-texture</b></a> could simply stop being
drawn when using it to fill areas.
</li>

<b>New option show-quick-symbol-info-on-space.</b> The option
<a href="operators/ide/show-quick-symbol-info-on-space.htm"><b>ide:show-quick-symbol-info-on-space</b></a>, if enabled
(as it is by default) will display information about a symbol in the
status bar when a space is typed after a symbol name in the listener
or in an editor buffer. This option may interfere with some input
methods that use multiple keystrokes for typing some characters, if
one of the keys in such a sequence is the spacebar. If this happens,
you can turn this option off, as described on the documentation page,
to avoid the problem.
</li>
<li id="172">
<b>New option find-in-files-search-subprojects-later.</b> The option
<a href="operators/ide/find-in-files-search-subprojects-later.htm"><b>ide:find-in-files-search-subprojects-later</b></a>
specifies the initial value of the <b>Search Subprojects Later</b>
checkbox on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/find-in-files-dialog.htm">Find In Files</a> dialog. The value
is remembered in the options file so it will be the same in the next

<a href="operators/ide/use-ide-debugger-on-all-processes.htm"><b>ide:use-ide-debugger-on-all-processes</b></a>
configuration option controls controls whether the IDE's debugger will

<a href="cggtk-relnotes.html">cggtk-relnotes.html</a>.
</h3>

<p id="190">
This section is repeated from the 10.0 release notes.
</p>
<p id="191">
Common Graphics and the IDE run on Windows and Linux with
GTK. Certain differences between the two operating systems and
windowing systems mean that some things do not work the same in
Windows as in GTK and vice versa. The functionality listed here
tries to handle the differences. Some of the
variables/operators/etc. are only available on one of the two platforms.
</p>

<h3 id="192">
Known bug with menu-items and buttons
</h3>

<p id="193">
<b>GTK Only</b>: all-black menu-items and half-black buttons.  There
is still a mystery on the GTK platform where all button widgets can
turn half black along a diagonal line, and all menu-items on some
platforms will be totally black.  This seems to happen only when
opening a project from the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a> dialog, though, so a
workaround is to not reopen a project from that dialog and instead to
use the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/recent-menu.htm">Recent menu</a>
or <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#open-project">File | Open Project</a> just afterward.  We
have tracked the problem down to the use of transparent-pane windows
such as the frame-child of a form window, but beyond that it is a
total mystery.
</p>

<h4 id="194">
Event handler processes
</h4>

<p id="195">
Because Linux currently does not use native threads and Windows does,
on Windows, all windows handle events in their own thread associated
with the window while on Linux/GTK, there is one event-handling
thread. <a href="operators/cg/d/default-application-window-subkey.htm"><b>default-application-window-subkey</b></a>, <a href="variables/cg/s_use-single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*use-single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a>, and
<a href="variables/cg/s_single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a> allow
distinguishing behavior when necessary. <a href="operators/cg/c/cg-process-wait.htm"><b>cg-process-wait</b></a> should be used on GTK instead of
<a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a> in event
handlers. See also <a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events-if-event-handler.htm"><b>process-pending-events-if-event-handler</b></a>.

<h4 id="196">
Miscellaneous
</h4>

<p id="197">
The <a href="operators/cg/w/with-message-window.htm"><b>with-message-window</b></a> window
is now a <a href="operators/cg/f/frameless-topmost-p.htm"><b>frameless-topmost-p</b></a>
window on the GTK platforms to avoid problems that it had otherwise.
This means that deselecting the owner window will close the message
window, and so it may be a good idea to display the message in an
additional place such as a status bar.
