The 10.1 documentation indicates on each
page whether the page was revised compared to the previon version of
the Allegro CL Updated Documentation. The extent of the revision is
indicated in the upper right corner where it says
<b>Allegro CL
version 
10.1</b>. There it also says one of:
</p><ul>
<li id="6">

<b>Unrevised from 10.0
to 10.1</b>: the contents of the page have not
been modified.

</li>
<li id="7">

<b>Minimally revised from
10.0</b> or <b>Minimally revised since
the initial 10.1 release</b>: typos and
other obvious mistakes have been corrected.

</li>
<li id="8">

<b>Moderately revised from
10.0</b> or <b>Moderately revised since
the initial 10.1 release</b>: the
revisions add new information or correct previously incorrect
information.

</li>
<li id="9">

<b>Significantly revised from
10.0</b> or <b>Significantly revised
since the initial 10.1 release</b>:
the contents include major additions or have been more or less wholly
rewritten. There is often a note on a significantly revised page or
in the
<a href="release-notes.htm">release-notes.htm</a> (search for the object name in
that document) saying
what has been added or changed.

</li>
<li id="10">

<b>This page is new
in 10.1</b>: the
page was not in the previous version of the Allegro
CL online documentation.

</li>
<li id="11">

<b>Page is generated automatically from other data and has been
regenerated
in 10.1</b>. The
page is generated anew with each release from other data (examples
include the index pages and the permuted index pages) and so is
necessarily different from its counterpart in the previous release.

</li>
<li id="12">
<b>Code change</b> or
<b>Object described on page has changed in
10.1</b> or <b>Code change</b> or
<b>Object described on page has changed since the initial
10.1 release</b>: the object being
described has been modified in the
10.1 release and
the page has changed to reflect those modifications (and perhaps in
other ways). The change is always described in
<a href="release-notes.htm">release-notes.htm</a> (search for the object name in
that document). Typical changes are new or changed arguments or new
argument defaults (for operators), or a different initial value (for
variables), but can be anything, including removal of the object from
the system.

</li>
</ul><p id="13">
Allegro CL documentation is regularly updated between releases.  <a href="http://franz.com/support/documentation/">This page</a> on
the Franz Inc. website (<a href="http://franz.com/">http://franz.com/</a>) has links to
the latest version of the Allegro CL documentation and says
whether there has been an update, and, if so, when. Links on that page
direct you to instructions for downloading the revised documentation
if an update is available.
</p><h3 id="14">Index</h3><p id="15">
The main page for the <strong>index</strong> for the Allegro CL
documentation is <a href="index.htm">index.htm</a>. Every documentation
HTML page has a link to the index on the Navigation Bar at the top and
bottom.  <a href="index.htm">index.htm</a> points to index pages for each
letter (some letters are combined). There are pages with Common
Graphics functionality and pages without Common Graphics
functionality. 
</p><h3 id="16">Permuted Index</h3><p id="17">
The main page for the <strong>permuted-index</strong> for the Allegro
CL documentation is <a href="permuted-index.htm">permuted-index.htm</a>. Every
documentation HTML page has a link to the permuted index on the
Navigation Bar at the top and bottom.  <a href="permuted-index.htm">permuted-index.htm</a>
points to index pages for each letter (some letters are
combined).
</p><p id="18">
The permuted index is generated from the link text of the index pages.
Every word in such link text is indexed. For example, the link to the
function <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>
appears under <b>B</b> (for <b>build</b>), <b>L</b> (for <b>lisp</b>)
and <b>I</b> (for <b>image</b>). This makes the permuted index a very
useful tool for finding information on any topic where you know
keywords but do not know which specifically appears in the index or
the first letter of the names of the relevant symbols.
</p><p id="19">
The permuted index has entries for each section heading of the essay
documentation (those in the same directory as this file). Since they
are indexed by each word in the heading, finding a section of interest
using a keyword in the heading is relatively easy with the permuted
index.  (The headings are not in the index because they mostly start
with "a" or "about" or "the" which are not words actually associated
with the topic covered.)
</p><h3 id="20">Table of Contents</h3><p id="21">
The <strong>table of contents</strong> of most of the essay documents
is in <a href="contents.htm">contents.htm</a>. Every documentation HTML page
has a link to <a href="contents.htm">contents.htm</a> (labeled <b>ToC</b>) on
the Navigation Bars at the top and bottom. The following documents are
not included in <a href="contents.htm">contents.htm</a>: <a href="aserve/aserve.html">aserve/aserve.html</a>,

<hr><h2 id="74"><a name="patches-2">4.2 Patches and updates</a></h2>

<p id="75">
An patch is a file (typically a fasl -- compiled Lisp -- file) which
either corrects some error in the product or provides some enhancement
or new feature. Patches are available from the Franz Inc. web site.
(Some patches, particularly those which implement an improvement, an
enhancement, or a new feature rather than a bug fix, are restricted to
supported customers only.) Patches are stored in both locations with a
directory structure that mirrors the distribution directory structure,
so that patch files can be downloaded into the correct directories of
the distribution. There are several ways to get patches:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="76">
The function <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> downloads patch files and
places them in the correct locations. On Windows, you may have to be
running as administrator to call <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>. As we note in the next
paragraph, there is a menu item on Windows that downloads updates and
updates images.
</li>
<li id="77">
The update program (<b>update.exe</b> on Windows, <b>update.sh</b> in
UNIX) will get patches if called with the <b>-u</b> option. On
Windows, there are menu items for these tasks. The <b>update.exe
(download new updates + rebuild images)</b> item will get updates and
update images. It asks for administrator privileges if it needs to be
administrator to do so.
</li>
<li id="78">
In the IDE, the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/download-dialog.htm">Download Patches</a> dialog will cause
patches to be downloaded when the <b>Download</b> button is clicked.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="79">
There are various kinds of patch files. 
</p>
<ul>
<li id="80">Files with names like <i>p8a002.001</i>. These are
called <i>patches</i> and are compiled Lisp files (despite not having
the extension <i>fasl</i>) which fixes some specific
problem or provides an enhancement or, sometimes, adds a new
feature). The names of these files encode information about their
applicability and use. Please do not rename them. The extension
indicates the patch version. Patches are often replaced (perhaps to
provide additional fixes, perhaps to fix an introduced problem). When
that happens, a new version (with a different extension). The patch
system ensures you have a consistent set of patches. These patch files
go in the <i>update/</i> directory of the Allegro
directory. Note the second character ("8" in the example) identifies
the version of Allegro CL and is the value of
<code>excl::*cl-patch-version-char*</code>.)
</li>
<li id="81">
Files with module names and three-digit numeric extensions
(top-level.001 or streams.003). These files replace Lisp library files
in the <i>code/</i> subdirectory of the Allegro
directory. (Most of these files are originally in the Lisp bundle file
and so you may not see the originals of these
files.) The system knows to look in the <i>code/</i>
subdirectory before looking in the bundle file. The names of these
files must also not be changed.
</li>
<li id="82">
Miscellaneous documentation and other files. Documentation files may
be updated from time to time and <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>update-allegro</b></a> will download these files as
well.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="83">
On the web site,
<a href="http://franz.com/">http://franz.com/</a>, go to the Allegro CL page,
choose Support, then click on the link to Updates/Patches and follow
the instructions.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="84"><a name="patch-further-2">4.3 Further update information</a></h2>

<p id="85">Note the following points. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="86">The patch files are numbered and coded by product, and they are 
    read in order, higher
    numbers first. The order in which they are read is very important. 
    Do not change the names
    of patch <i>fasl</i> files. A single patch may have various 
    versions. This means the patch
    has been further updated. </li>
  <li id="87">Do not use an patch for one release of Allegro CL 
      with another
      release. (Patches are placed in a subdirectory of the Allegro 
      directory. Since each new release (typically) has a different 
      Allegro directory,
      you can have more than one distribution on a single machine,
      and patches in each one.
      If you do that, be sure that patches for a particular release
      are placed only in that release's Allegro directory.) </li>
</ul>



<hr><h2 id="88"><a name="patch-get-all-2">4.4 Should you get all patches?</a></h2>

<p id="89">
Whether or not you should get all available patches depends 
on your current tolerance for instability. Because 
patches are less well tested than releases, patches may 
occasionally introduce errors as well as fix problems. 
</p>
<p id="90">
However, even a correct patch may introduce instability: 
if a patch enables a feature which was previously 
ignored or signals an error (correctly) where none was 
previously signaled, your code may fail because the 
patch uncovered a problem which was previously unnoticed. 
Suppose, for example, a patch causes certain declarations to 
be used during compilation (without the patch they are ignored). 
Such a patch would not fix a bug (since ignoring declarations is 
permitted) but if your code happened to contain incorrect declarations, 
then the patch would be destabilizing. (Without the patch, the wrong 
declarations were ignored and so did not harm. With the patch, they are used.)
</p>
<p id="91">
The potential impact of a patch is given in the LOG file in the update
directory. Here are two entries from the 5.0 patch LOG (the 
10.1 patch
LOG file will be organized similarly):
</p>
<pre id="92">
   Mon Sep 14 11:27:52 PDT 1998
   Patch: update/p0a001.001
   Fixes a bug where find-restarts, when given the optional condition 
   argument, would not consider restarts that are not associated with 
   any condition.
   <b>Impact: Should be minor</b>

   Tue Sep 1 14:33:29 PDT 1998
   Patch: update/p0b002.001
   Fixes self tail recursive call with intermixed args. 
   Problem resulted in errors in compiled code, 
   not in interpreted.
   <b>Impact: Recommended.</b>
</pre>
<p id="93">
Notice the Impact line (made bold for emphasis). It provides an
assessment of how destabilizing a patch may be. Note that in these
cases, one is minor and the other patch (which fixes a problem where
compiled code ran incorrectly) is recommended.
</p>
<p id="94">
If you are in a development cycle, our advice is to get all available
patches for a platform (machine type) and Allegro CL
version. Patches for associated products (such as CLIM) should be
included as well.
</p>
<p id="95">
But if you are preparing a delivery, we advise you to be selective,
perhaps getting only the patches that deal with problems you report.
</p>
<p id="96">
Note that we have previously advised even users who are developing
applications rather than preparing for delivery to only include
patches when they experienced the problem fixed by the patch. There
are pluses and minuses to each recommendation. While including all
patches gives you all available fixes, as we said above, patches are
not as well tested as releases and sometimes a update introduces a new
problem or bug. However, we have changed our advice for when you are
developing because many patches are for performance, and therefore
generally useful, and because problems introduced by patches, while
they do happen, are uncommon and are usually fixed quite quickly
(typically with a new patch), and because it is relatively easy
to back out a patch if it causes problems.
</p>
<p id="97">
Note that the report created by <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a> lists all patches
included in the image. It is very important that this information be
included with a bug report.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="98"><a name="patch-what-todo-2">4.5 What to do with patches when you have downloaded them</a></h2>

<p id="99">
<a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>update-allegro</b></a> downloads
patches but does not create new images.  To create new images, exit
Lisp (if you are running it) and
run <b><i>update.sh</i></b> on UNIX machines
and <b><i>update.exe</i></b>
on Windows machines.  These scripts will update all Allegro-supplied
image (dxl) files by starting Lisp with the dxl file and
calling <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. They also make backups of
the the dxl files. You must recreate any image files you created
yourself.
</p>

<p id="100">
The usage for <b>update.sh</b> is
</p>

<pre id="101">
update.sh [-u] [--proxy proxy] [--proxy-auth auth] [ --skip-ide]
</pre>

<p id="102">
Without any arguments, rebuild images to contain all downloaded
patches.  With the <b>-u</b> argument, download new patches before
rebuilding images. <b>--proxy</b> allows specification of a proxy host
and port.  It is typically something like
"cobweb:3128". <b>--proxy-auth</b> allows specification of proxy basic
authentication. It is typically your password for the proxy. You may
specify <b>--proxy</b> without
<b>--proxy-auth</b>. 
</p>
<p id="103">
--skip-ide causes the updating process to skip rebuilding the allegro
images (which are the images with the IDE that start the IDE when
started). The IDE is only available on Linux and the Mac (and
Windows).
</p>
<p id="104">
See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="105">
<b>update.exe</b> is on the submenu of the Allegro CL menu item on the
<b>Start</b> menu on Windows. The typical way to run it is to choose
that menu item (actually, there are two items, one downloads patches,
the other just patches). But it can also be run in a Command Prompt
window. The usage for <b>update.exe</b> (on Windows) is
</p>

<pre id="106">
update.exe [-u] [-h hostname] [-p proxy-host] [-P proxy-auth] [-f]
</pre>

<p id="107">
<b>-u</b> means update before rebuilding. <b>-h</b> -- the value of
the hostname passed to <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> (for updating). -p and -P
are the proxy host and proxy authority passed to <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>. <b>-f</b> -- forces
rebuild even when no new patches (only needed when <b>-u</b> is
specified).
</p>
<p id="108">
<b>Note of specifying heap starts and sizes</b>. You may wish to
specify the starting positions and initial sizes of the Allegro CL
Lisp heap and the aclmalloc heap. You may also want to specify the
initial sizes of newspace and oldspace. These are set when using
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> to build an
image with
the <code>:lisp-heap-start</code>, <code>:lisp-heap-size</code>,
<code>:aclmalloc-heap-start</code>,
<code>:aclmalloc-heap-size</code>, <code>:newspace</code>,
and <code>:oldpsace</code> keyword arguments. If you want starts
and sizes other than the defaults in the images built by
<b>update.exe</b>/<b>update.sh</b>, you can set the various
environment variables listed in <a href="building-images.htm#arguments-with-environment-defaults-1">Arguments to
build-lisp-image 3: defaults taken from environment
variables</a>. If any of those variables are set when updating
images, the image will be built as if the corresponding argument was
set to the variable value.
</p>

<p id="109">
<b>Note on backups of dxl files</b>: the first time
<i>update.sh/bat</i> is run, the dxl files are copied to
files with `orig' added -- <i>mlisp.dxl</i> to
<i>mlisporig.dxl</i>, e.g. The second time, they are
copied with `old' added -- <i>mlisp.dxl</i> to
<i>mlispold.dxl</i>, e.g. On subsequent runs, the backup
may not be done correctly. Please move <i>*old.dxl</i>
to <i>*oldn.dxl</i> (for some <i>n</i> -- for example,
<i>mlispold.dxl</i> to
<i>mlispold1.dxl</i>) before updating to ensure that the
backups are done correctly.
</p>

<p id="110">
<b>Backing out of patches</b>: you may occasionally discover that an
updated image does not work properly. (Perhaps the patch was faulty,
or perhaps the fix, whatever it is, interacts incorrectly with your
application.)  To back out of patches, (1) rename the new dxl files,
(2) copy the original dxl files (they will have "old" or "orig"
appended to their filenames) to their original names, and (3) move
any <i>new</i> fasl files out of the <i>code/</i>
subdirectory. You are now back to where you were before running
<b><i>update.sh</i></b>
or <b><i>update.bat</i></b>.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="111"><a name="update-bundle-2">4.6 Updating the bundle file</a></h2>


<p id="112">
The bundle file contains a collection of fasl files associated with
Allegro CL modules. When a module is autoloaded or loaded by a call to
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a>, it is typically
loaded from the bundle file. (If you see the message "Fast loading
from bundle...", the file is being loaded from the bundle file.)  The
location and name of the bundle file are returned by the function
<a href="operators/excl/bundle-pathname.htm"><b>bundle-pathname</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="113">
Sometimes module fasl files have to be updated. In that case, a new
file is downloaded from the Franz Inc. update repository and is
placed in the <i>code/</i> subdirectory of the Allegro
directory.  The system always checks the code directory first for a
module fasl file before looking in the bundle file. That assures that
the latest version of a module fasl file is loaded.
</p>
<p id="114">
However, it is often useful to update the bundle file to include all
the updated module fasl files. In Allegro CL
, this update is performed
automatically (when <b>update.sh</b>
or <b><i>update.bat</i></b>
is run).
</p>





<hr><hr><h2 id="115"><a name="reporting-bugs-1">5.0 Reporting bugs</a></h2>

<p id="116">
Before reporting a bug, please study this document and the ANSI CL
Standard document. 
</p>

<p id="117">
A report that such and such happened is generally of limited value
in determining the cause of a problem. It is very important for us to
know what happened before the error occurred: what you typed in, what
Allegro CL typed out. A verbatim log may be needed. If you are able to
localize the bug and reliably duplicate it with a minimal amount of
code, it will greatly expedite repairs.
</p>

<p id="118">
It is much easier to find a bug that is generated when a single
isolated function is applied than a bug that is generated somewhere
when an enormous application is loaded.  Although we are intimately
familiar with Allegro CL, you are familiar with your application and
the context in which the bug was observed. Context is also important
in determining whether the bug is really in Allegro CL or in something
that it depends on, such as the operating system. 
</p>

<p id="119">
To this end, we request that your reports to us of bugs or of
suspected bugs include the following information. If any of the
information is missing, it is likely to delay or complicate our
response.
</p>

<ul>
<li id="120">
<b>dribble-bug or print-system-state output</b>.  The function <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a> is like <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/dribble.htm"><b>common-lisp:dribble</b></a> but prefaces the
transcript with information about the image being run (platform, OS,
Allegro CL version, patches loaded, and much else). Please include the
output of <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a> in the
first report of any bug or problem. The function <a href="operators/excl/print-system-state.htm"><b>print-system-state</b></a> prints the
information about the platform, patches, etc. that goes into a
dribble-bug file. You can use that function to print the data to send
to us instead of using <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a>, but that information, however,
obtained should be included in each bug report.
</li>
<li id="121">
<b>Information about you.</b> Tell us who you are, where you are and
how you can be reached (an electronic mail address if you are
reachable via the Internet, a postal address otherwise, and your
telephone number), and in whose name the license is held. It is best
to put the email address in the text of the message (in case the
mailer program messes up the return address). Please include a

source fragment that will duplicate the problem, and a log
(e.g. produced with <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a>) of a complete session with
Allegro CL that illustrates the bug. Note that dribble output does not
log certain messages printed by the Operating System or printed by
foreign code called by Lisp or routines called by <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a> and related functions. If
such output is relevant, please capture it in an Emacs buffer or in

<hr><h2 id="137"><a name="core-dumps-2">5.2 Core files: when they are useful and what to do with them</a></h2>

<p id="138">
Certain kinds of Allegro CL errors/problems cause failure of the Lisp
and can result in the dumping of a core file. Sometimes this occurs
when unexpected exceptions from the operating system make continued
operation impossible. Sometimes it is due to a GC orm stack error. (GC
errors are discussed in <a href="gc.htm#gc-errors-1">gc
errors</a> in <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a>.) Often you are asked
whether you want a core file with a question like:
</p>
<pre id="139">
  Would you like to dump core for debugging before exiting(y or n)?
</pre>
<p id="140">
If you answer <b>y</b>, then an attempt will be made to produce what
is known as a "core file".  Core files are usually produced on Unix
and Unix-like systems, they have many different shapes and levels of
usefulness. In order to make the best use of time spent and space
used in preserving and communicating core dumps to Franz, here are
some guidelines to follow when a core is produced:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="141">
<b>If possible, find another way</b>: core files are sometimes large,
sometimes incomplete, and often it is hard to glean enough information
from a core to figure out what went wrong.  A better strategy is to
either find a reproducible test case which we can replicate in our
offices, or else allow us ftp/vpn access to your machine to reproduce
the failure.
</li>
<li id="142">
<b>Send it all</b>: the core file is never complete; it always relies
on the original lisp executable (usually called <b>mlisp</b>,
<b>mlisp8</b>, <b>alisp</b>, or <b>alisp8</b>, or renamed as your
application) and on the <b>"acldll"</b> (which is the Allegro CL
shared-library, having either .dll, .so, .sl, or .dylib extensions).
It may also rely on a .pll file, which can be found out in a running
image by noting the value returned by
<code>(excl:pll-file)</code> - a null return means that there is
no pll file, and a pathname is the location and name of the .pll file
- that should also be sent.  Note: Even if you believe that we already
have the executable file or the shared-library, or even the .pll,
include all of it into the directory that you will send us.
</li>
<li id="143">
<b>Don't use email</b>: a usable core and its entourage are much too
large to send through email; instead, package it up into a file
suitable to send via FTP and
contact <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> for
instructions on how to send it. (Franz Inc. no longer maintains an
anonymous FTP server.)
