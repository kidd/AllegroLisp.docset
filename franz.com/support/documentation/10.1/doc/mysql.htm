MySQL is a powerful, efficient, production ready open-source database
that runs on all popular platforms. There are language bindings for
most popular languages. This document describes the bindings for the
Allegro Common Lisp language.
</p>

<p id="6">
MySQL was written by the founders of the
MySQL AB company. It supports and enhances MySQL and owns the code.
They release an open source version with restrictions and will license
you to use MySQL for commercial purposes. See <a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a>.
</p>
<p id="7">
There exist ODBC drivers for MySQL.  ODBC offers a method of
programmatically accessing a database that's somewhat portable
across very different databases.
</p>
<p id="8">
Allegro CL users can access MySQL through the Allegro ODBC
library. With this being the case one might ask why 
would anyone want to use the library we describe here?  We'll
describe the pros and cons of ODBC first:
</p>

<h3 id="9">
Using ODBC:
</h3>

<ol>
<li id="10">
ODBC offers a portable framework for accessing varying databases.
Once connected to a database you direct the database via
SQL commands in the database's native format. Thus if you want
portability between database vendors you still have to be careful 
not to use SQL commands that are not portable.
</li>
<li id="11">
ODBC imposes its own model of what a database is and this
may not be a good match to a particular database. Thus you may
lose efficiency when interacting with certain databases.
</li>
<li id="12">
Since ODBC was started by Microsoft, ODBC is available
for free on Windows and well supported by database vendors.
On Unix, ODBC drivers are generally not database vendor written, 
can be expensive (although one could use ODBC with MySQL using 
totally free libraries.)
</li>
<li id="13">
Using ODBC requires using
ODBC driver manager libraries which are usually written in C.
When a command is sent to a database the C library sits
and waits for a response to be returned. While it is waiting
Lisp is blocked from running.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="14">
Using Allegro MySQL Direct Connect:
</h3>

<ol>
<li id="15">
This library connects directly to the MySQL server and 
speaks the same protocol used by all clients in all languages
that work with the MySQL server.  Therefore there is no
more efficient way to programmatically access a MySQL database.
</li>
<li id="16">
When data is returned by the MySQL server Lisp has access
to the network buffers in which the data arrives.  Lisp can convert
the data into the desired final form immediately without
allocating space for intermediate forms of the data needed
in a multi-level MySQL interface.
</li>
<li id="17">
Each database has important and unique features and MySQL
is no exception.  MySQL has the notion of an autoincrement column
that's ideal for automatically creating a unique number to
represent a row in a table. Inserting a new row and 
retrieving the unique id assigned is a complex process using ODBC.
With this library however the response to the insert command
includes the unique id value, thus it's trivial to use this feature.
</li>
<li id="18">
Because normal Lisp socket I/O is used to communicate with 
the MySQL server, only one Lisp thread will block
while awaiting a response from the server.
</li>
<li id="19">
The downside of using this library is that the code
will only work with MySQL.  However, the code looks very 
similar to Allegro ODBC so if there were a need to port 
to Allegro ODBC it wouldn't be too difficult (depending on how
many unique features of MySQL (like autoincrement columns) were used.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="20">
Symbols implementing the Allegro MySQL facility are in the
<code>dbi.mysql</code> package. The Allegro MySQL module is the
<code>:mysql</code> module and can be loaded by evaluating
<code>(require :mysql)</code>. 
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="21"><a name="mysql-basic-1">2.0 The Basic Operation of Allegro MySQL</a></h2>

<p id="22">
To access a MySQL database you call <a href="operators/mysql/connect.htm"><b>connect</b></a> to connect to the database.  Then
you repeatedly call <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a>
to send commands to the database and get results back.  Finally you
call <a href="operators/mysql/disconnect.htm"><b>disconnect</b></a> to
disconnect from the database.
</p>
<p id="23">
You can call <a href="operators/mysql/connect.htm"><b>connect</b></a>
more than once to establish multiple simultaneous connections to the
database. This is useful, for example, if you want to create a pool
of ready-to-use database connections for an AllegroServe web server
application.
</p>
<p id="24">
<a href="operators/mysql/connect.htm"><b>connect</b></a> has an
<i>external-format</i> keyword argument which allows you
to specify the external format of the connection.
</p>
<p id="25">
When data is returned it is converted to the appropriate format.
See <a href="#conversions-1">Section 4.0 Conversions</a> below for details.
</p>

<p id="26">
A single MySQL connection can only handle one query at a time (where
is a query begins when an sql command is executed and ends when the
last result row is returned). It is oaky to create more than one
connection to a mysql database and run a query in each connection
simultaneously. In this case you must be careful to pass the
connection you want to use as the value of the <b>:db</b> keyword
argument to the mysql functions.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="27"><a name="mysql-errors-2">2.1 MySQL Errors</a></h2>

<p id="28">
MySQL errors have condition <a href="classes/mysql/mysql-error.htm"><code>mysql-error</code></a> or, when appropriate,
the <a href="classes/mysql/mysql-protocol-error.htm"><code>mysql-protocol-error</code></a>, a subclass
of <a href="classes/mysql/mysql-error.htm"><code>mysql-error</code></a>.

Note that we count on the fact that the <a href="operators/mysql/connect.htm"><b>connect</b></a> function not only returns the
connection to the database but also sets the <a href="variables/mysql/s_mysql_s.htm"><code>*mysql*</code></a> variable to the value of that
connection. The value of <a href="variables/mysql/s_mysql_s.htm"><code>*mysql*</code></a> is used as the default value for
the <i>db</i> keyword argument, thus this last
connection is used for subsequent <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a> and <a href="operators/mysql/disconnect.htm"><b>disconnect</b></a> functions.  This makes it easy
to work interactively with the database

style when writing programs that use this interface. In a program it is
best to be explicit about the database you're accessing and not depend
on a global variable that some other component of your program may
modify.

MySQL's version of the sql language supports a number of extensions
which allow you to get information about the database itself.
This information is returned as rows of data just like

the tables in the database and to find out the scheme
of a particular table

MySQL can store large binary objects (blobs) as well as numbers and
strings.  Here we see how to store a five element array of type
(unsigned-byte 8) in the database.  This is done by converting the
array into a string with <a href="operators/mysql/mysql-escape-sequence.htm"><b>mysql-escape-sequence</b></a> and then storing it
like any other string.  Note that <a href="operators/mysql/mysql-escape-sequence.htm"><b>mysql-escape-sequence</b></a> must be used to
escape strings as well as arrays of (unsigned-byte 8).  This is
because we are generating an sql statement at runtime and it is
important that the MySQL parser be able to parse that sql statement.
Certain characters appearing unescaped in the string would confuse the
sql parser.
</p>

<pre id="42">
cl-user(30): (connect :user &quot;jkf&quot; :password &quot;jkf&quot; :database &quot;test&quot;)

<p id="43">
Often you would like for a row in one table to reference
a row in another table. This is done using keys.
If you want a row in table A to point to a row in table B
then in table B you designate one column as a key column.
No two rows in a table have the same value for a key 
column, thus a key column value can be used to find
a distinct row.  Thus in table B one column is designated
a key column and in a column in table A you store a
key column value from table B.  The value in column
A is called a 'foreign key' since it's a key value
from some other table.
</p>
<p id="44">
One problem you face then is how do you create a unique key value for
each row in a table?  MySQL makes this very easy.  You designate a row
to be auto_increment and every time you add a row MySQL will
automatically give that column a value one higher that the last value
it stored in that column.  You can find out what value was stored in
the auto_increment column by using the <a href="operators/mysql/mysql-insert-id.htm"><b>mysql-insert-id</b></a> function right after the
row was inserted.  This saves you the trouble of doing a query to find
out the key value for the last inserted row.
</p>
<p id="45">
Here's an example of using an auto_increment column.  We're
setting up a contest between pairs of players.  We want
to record the players' first and last names and then
record the pairings between the players.

All data returned by the MySQL server is in the form of characters.
Even numbers like 385 are returned as a sequence of the characters

The <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a> and <a href="operators/mysql/sql-start.htm"><b>sql-start</b></a> functions send an sql

server will be responding with a table (that is a sequence of rows
with each row comprising the same columns of data).  Before the data
is returned descriptions of the columns are returned. This description
includes the column name and the type of data found in the
column. Based on column type data, the <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a> function computes the conversion it
will do for each column. All of the column information is stored in a
list of mysql-field objects stored in the MySQL object that holds the

If you use the <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a>

row of data until it returns <code>nil</code> which means
no more rows are available.

<p id="53">
At the end of this section, we describe the datatypes that might be
converted and what they will be converted to. Briefly, integers,
floats, and text or blobs are dataypes suitable for conversion.

The application can tell the MySQL interface whether it should convert
the data returned by the MySQL server. The
<i>convert</i> argument to <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a> and <a href="operators/mysql/sql-start.htm"><b>sql-start</b></a> serves this purpose. The
<i>convert</i> argument is a list of values one for each
column to be returned. If the value for a column is true then the
column data is converted to the appropriate type. If the value is
<code>nil</code> then the data is returned as a string.
</p>
<p id="55">
If there are more columns then elements in the list, no conversion is
done on the extra columns (as if the elements were <code>nil</code>).

<p id="56">
<i>convert</i> can also be a symbol, in which case it is
treated as if it were a list with as many elements as columns, each

<code>:blob</code>, it is treated as the list <code>(:blob

non cons value is equivalent to <code>t</code>.) In the
remaining discussion, we assume <i>convert</i> is a
list.
</p>
<p id="58">
The default value for the <i>convert</i> argument is
<code>t</code>.
</p>

<p id="59">
The MySQL server returns the type of each column with the result set
and it is this type that determines which conversions are possible on
this data. 
</p>

<p id="60">
Because there are several types of columns suitable for conversion, it
is somewhat complicated to make sure that each column is converted as
you wish. (You may want integers converted but floats not, for
example, and you probably do want blobs converted but text not, as the
default string format is suitable for text but not for blobs.)
</p>
<p id="61">
The <i>blob</i> and <i>float</i> arguments
to <a href="operators/mysql/sql.htm"><b>sql</b></a> and <a href="operators/mysql/sql-start.htm"><b>sql-start</b></a> provide finer control
over conversion, as described under the headings below.
</p>
<p id="62">
Integer data in a column is converted when the corresponding element
of the <i>convert</i> list is non-<code>nil</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="63">Conversion of float columns</h4>

<p id="64">
MySQL supports single and double float values. The default conversion
function for these column types will return an integer if the database
returns an integer value (e.g. "385") and otherwise will return
either a single-float or double-float value if the database returns a
value with a fractional part (e.g. "385.44").
</p>
<p id="65">
If the <i>float</i> argument is <code>nil</code>, no float columns are converted regardless of the
value of <i>convert</i>. If <i>float</i>
is non-<code>nil</code>, a float column is converted if
the element of the <i>convert</i> list corresponding to
the column is non-<code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p id="66">
When the conversion is done to a float, as must be done for a number
like "-123.12", the type of float (single or double) created is
determined as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="67">
If the column whose value is being converted has type
<code>float</code> then the resulting value is a Lisp integer or
a single-float value.
</li>
<li id="68">
If the column whose value is being converted has type
<code>double</code> then the resulting value is a Lisp integer
or a double-float value.
</li>
<li id="69">
If the column whose value is being converted has type
<code>decimal</code> then the resulting value is a Lisp integer
or a double-float value. A decimal value is a fixed point number
(e.g. decimal(13,2) is a 13 digit number with two digits to the right
of the decimal point.)
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="70">Conversion of text or blob columns</h4>

<p id="71">
MySQL supports both text and blob valued columns. The only difference
between text and blob in MySQL is that text values are compared case
insensitively and blob values are compared case sensitively. When a
text or blob valued column is retrieved the MySQL interface is told
only that the column is "text or blob", but not which one it is.
</p>
<p id="72">
If the value is a text value then the application would typically like
a Lisp string returned.  If the value is a blob (e.g. a jpeg picture)
then the application most likely wants an array of bytes (an
(unsigned-byte 8) array in Lisp terms) returned. 
</p>
<p id="73">
The <i>blob</i> argument combined with
<i>convert</i> determines how "text or blob" columns are
converted. If <i>blob</i> is true, then if the element
in the <i>convert</i> list corresponding to a "text or
blob" column is also true, the string is converted to an array of
(unsigned-byte 8) values. 
</p>
<p id="74">
If <i>blob</i> is <code>nil</code>, then
conversion of a text or blob column is still controlled by the value
of the corresponding element in the <i>convert</i> list:
if that value is <code>:blob</code>, conversion is done. If that
value is <code>nil</code> or any non-<code>nil</code> value other than <code>:blob</code>, no
conversion is done and contents are returned as a Lisp string.
</p>
<p id="75">
The <i>blob</i> argument
defaults to <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p id="76">
Thus <i>convert</i> and <i>blob</i>
together provide extra control for columns whose data is
text or blobs. There are three cases:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="77">
All text or blob columns contain text.
</li>
<li id="78">
All text or blob columns contain blobs.
</li>
<li id="79">
Some text or blob columns contain text and some contain blobs.
</li>
</ol>
<p id="80">
In the first case, no conversion should be done (because all text or
blob columns are text and text is already in the correct format). Make
<i>blob</i> &nbsp;<code>nil</code>
make sure none of the relevant elements of the
<i>convert</i> list has value <code>:blob</code>.
</p>
<p id="81">
In the second, assuming you want conversion at all, all text or blob
columns should be converted to (unsigned-byte 8) arrays (because all
text or blob columns are blobs and blobs need conversion). Make
<i>blob</i> &nbsp;<code>t</code>
and control conversion using the <i>convert</i>
argument.
</p>
<p id="82">
In the third case, assuming you want conversion at all, some columns
should be converted and some not converted. If most are blobs, make
<i>blob</i> &nbsp;<code>t</code>
and make the value of <i>convert</i> a list with <code>nil</code> for each text column. If most columns are text,
make <i>blob</i> &nbsp;<code>nil</code> and make the value of
<i>convert</i> a list with <code>:blob</code>
for each blob column.
</p>

<p id="83">
The following table summarizes what we have just said, showing whether
or not conversion is done, given the value of
<i>blob</i> and the value of the
<i>convert</i> argument for the column in
question. (Again, if <i>convert</i> is a symbol, it is
interpreted to be a list all of whose elements are that symbol.)

<p id="98">
Allegro MySQL provides limited support for stored procedure calls. At
present, only stored procedures that return a single set of results
can be used. To turn on this support, you must establish a database
connection using <a href="operators/mysql/connect.htm"><b>dbi.mysql:connect</b></a> that includes
<code>dbi.mysql:CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS</code> in the set of flags
passed as the <i>client-flags</i> keyword argument.

<hr><hr><h2 id="100"><a name="mysql-mp-1">6.0 MySQL and multiprocessing</a></h2>

<p id="101">
A database connection is a socket connection which is used to
transmit requests to MySQL and to retrieve responses.  Sending a
request is not an atomic operation and retrieving a response is not an
atomic operation.
</p>
<p id="102">
Thus two separate Lisp threads using the same connection will likely
overlap in their writes and reads leading to garbage being sent to the
mysql server or incomplete results being read by the Lisp threads.
</p>
<p id="103">
So there are two choices:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="104">
Use a locking to ensure that one thread makes a complete request and
retrieves a complete response before any other thread is allowed to
use this connection. (See <a href="multiprocessing.htm#process-locks-1">Process locks</a>
in <a href="multiprocessing.htm">multiprocessing.htm</a> for more information on
process locks in Allegro CL. See
also <a href="multiprocessing.htm#gates-1">gates</a>
in the same document for another way to effectively lock processes.
</li>
<li id="105">
Allocate one a database connection per Lisp thread. MySQL then
thinks it's talking to multiple separate clients and this works
perfectly well.
