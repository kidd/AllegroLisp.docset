This document describes the issues of case sensitivity and modern and
ANSI modes.
</p><hr><hr><h2 id="6"><a name="modern-mode-1">1.0 Allegro CL Modern Mode</a></h2>

<p id="7">
The Modern/ANSI mode choice refers to the Lisp image's <i>case
mode</i>. As described elsewhere in this document, a case mode is a
combination of two things: (a) the Lisp symbol reader's default
behavior, and (b) which case (upper case or lower case) is used to
store pre-defined Lisp symbols which name functions, variables,
classes, etc. The case mode being used has a big effect on how source
files and data files are read and how their data may be represented
internally or output by Lisp. Thus, it is important to understand how
the case mode choice affects one's Lisp programming. But first, a
couple of comments about compatibility.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="8"><a name="modern-background-2">1.1 Modern mode background</a></h2>


<p id="9">
The ANSI Common Lisp specification states that all pre-defined
Common Lisp functions, variables, classes, etc. are represented as
symbols whose names are stored in all upper case. Thus, for example,
suppose you wish to evaluate the following Lisp source expression:
</p>

<pre id="10">
(member 'cat '(dog cat mouse))
</pre>
<p id="11">
When Lisp reads this expression, either by loading a source file, or
from a user typing it to a Lisp Listener, the symbol reader internally
converts all symbol names to their upper case equivalents. (As an
aside, please note that case of some non-English letters can actually
depend on a user's locale. Thus, it is possible to have the Lisp
reader's behavior depend on the environment in which it is being
run. Other than mentioning it here, we disregard this problem in the
rest of this document.)
</p>
<p id="12">
Thus, after being read by Lisp, the form above is equivalent to the
following:
</p>

<pre id="13">
(MEMBER 'CAT '(DOG CAT MOUSE))
</pre>
<p id="14">
When Lisp evaluates this expression, it finds that the first element,
MEMBER, matches the pre-defined Lisp symbol,
<code>MEMBER</code>, whose function when applied to the
arguments as described, returns the following:
</p>

<pre id="15">
(CAT MOUSE)
</pre>
<p id="16">
As can be seen by the examples below, the ANSI Lisp symbol reader is
case-insensitive. In other words, each of the following expressions,
when read in ANSI mode, returns the same result:
</p>

<pre id="17">
(Member 'cat '(dog cAT mOUSE)) 
  <b>RETURNS</b> (CAT MOUSE)
(MEMBER 'CAT '(Dog Cat Mouse))
  <b>RETURNS</b> (CAT MOUSE)
(mEmBEr 'Cat '(dog CAT mouse))
  <b>RETURNS</b> (CAT MOUSE)
(member 'CAT '(dog cat mouse))
  <b>RETURNS</b> (CAT MOUSE)
(MEMBER 'CAT '(DOG CAT MOUSE))
  <b>RETURNS</b> (CAT MOUSE)
;;  and so on....
</pre>

<p id="18">
One of the features of such a case-insensitive reader is that it
allows programmers to write source code using mixed case knowing that
Lisp will canonicalize (and thus ignore the case variants of) the
symbol names. Some programmers may choose to adopt a coding style
where they indicate predefined Lisp symbols in upper case:
</p>

<pre id="19">
(DEFUN my-function (arg1 &OPTIONAL arg2)
 (WHEN (my-predicate arg1 arg2)
  (PRINT "Success")))
</pre>

<p id="20">
An alternate style might be simply to capitalize all symbols:
</p>

<pre id="21">
(Defun My-Function (Arg1 &Optional Arg2)
 (When (My-Predicate Arg1 Arg2)
  (Print "Success")))
</pre>

<p id="22">
One can have many different such case-variant styles even within a
single file. Whether it is good or not to have such styles is another
matter. However, as far as Lisp is concerned, all (unescaped) symbols
are converted to upper case as they are read.
</p>


<hr><h2 id="23"><a name="ansi-mode-2">1.2 ANSI mode problems</a></h2>

<p id="24">
As long as Lisp programs only require that symbol names be in upper
case, there would be no problem using the default ANSI specified Lisp
reader. However, difficulties occur when interfacing to non-Lisp
programming systems which are increasingly using lower case
case-sensitive identifiers. The case-insensitive nature of the Common
Lisp symbol reader creates hurdles for programmers wishing to
interface to such systems.
</p>
<p id="25">
For example, if a user wants to establish a foreign function
associated with the Microsoft Windows API function
<code>CreateDIBitmap()</code> (which is used to <b>C</b>reate a
<b>D</b>evice <b>I</b>ndependent <b>B</b>itmap), the default Lisp
reader action is to turn the name into upper case. Thus, one may have
source code which reads as follows:
</p>

<pre id="26">
(defun call-windows ()
 (CreateDIBitmap ...))
</pre>
<p id="27">
If, however, an error occurs during the execution of this call, the
Lisp stack backtrace displayed by the debugger is hard to read due to
missing word boundary information in the function's name:
</p>

<pre id="28">
(CREATEDIBITMAP ...)
</pre>
<p id="29">
Processing XML data is another example which demonstrates Lisp's power
as well as the ANSI-mode hurdle with case-sensitive data.
Suppose we have employee information in XML format as shown in the
following fragment:
</p>

<pre id="30">
 &lt;Employee OfficePhone=&quot;510-452-2000&quot;
           SSNumber=&quot;111-22-3333&quot;
           HomePhone=&quot;510-555-2222&quot;&gt;
 Franz Liszt
 &lt;IdPhoto href=&quot;liszt.jpg&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/Employee&gt;
</pre>

<p id="31">
A natural way to represent such elements in Lisp is with keyword-style
lists, and this is what Franz' open-source xml-parser returns.  XML is
intrinsically case sensitive, and the DTD (Document Type Definition)
mandates the case of all tag and attribute names.  Thus, the above
expression can be represented with case-preserving tags, but escapes
are needed when the list is printed in ANSI-mode:
</p>

<pre id="32">
 ((|Employee| |OfficePhone| "510-452-2000"
              |SSNumber| "111-22-3333"
              |HomePhone| "510-555-2222")
  "Franz Liszt"
  ((|IdPhoto| |href| "liszt.jpg")))
</pre>

<p id="33">
A reason to choose symbols for tags is that we can then use powerful
Lisp tools such as <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/destruct.htm"><b>destructuring-bind</b></a> to
further process the parsed structure. Element attributes in XML
consist of key/value pairs, but the attributes attached to any node
are unordered, and it can be tedious to extract some set of attributes
from a node. This pattern is so very similar to Lisp keywords that
exploiting Lisp lambda-list binding is an obvious mechanism for
extracting and collecting attributes and their values. In ANSI mode,
however, Lisp code which deals with case-sensitive symbol tags needs a
lot of escaping, making the code both hard to read and hard to write.
</p>

<pre id="34">
 ;; An XML phone directory processor
 (case (car element)
   ((|CompanyOfficer| |Manager| |Employee| |Consultant|)
    (destructuring-bind
        ((tag &key ((|OfficePhone| office-phone))
                   ((|HomePhone| home-phone))
                   ((|SSNumber| ss-number))
              &allow-other-keys)
         &rest content)
        element
      (my-formatted-output content tag office-phone
                           home-phone ss-number)
      ...))
   (|Customer| ...)
   ...)
</pre>

<p id="35">
The above code works in either ANSI mode or Modern mode Lisp,
but we'll see below how this code
can be rewritten more felicitously in Modern mode.
</p>
<p id="36">
Many Lisp programmers have chosen to avoid the symbol
case-insensitivity problem by using strings instead of symbols to
represent externally named objects.  Strings are always read with
their case preserved.  Unfortunately, by using strings, a Lisp
programmer gives up using Lisp variables for case-sensitive external
identifiers.  Furthermore, one gives up other features unique to
symbols such as fast <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/eq.htm"><b>eq</b></a> comparisons or being able to
store the identifiers in separate package name spaces.
</p>

<p id="37">
Note that ANSI Common Lisp does provide some support for case mode
choice, using <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a>
and various global variables.  See
<a href="#readtable-case-1">Section 3.0 readtable-case</a> for details.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="38"><a name="modern-mode-2">1.3 Modern Mode</a></h2>

<p id="39">
Modern programming environments almost universally use case sensitive
lower case identifiers. Modern mode in Lisp thus eases interfacing to
such environments. It also simplifies the Lisp reader.
</p>
<p id="40">
As opposed to ANSI Mode, symbols in Modern mode are simply treated as
<i>WYSIWYG</i> (<i>W</i>hat <i>Y</i>ou <i>S</i>ee <i>I</i>s
<i>W</i>hat <i>Y</i>ou <i>G</i>et). In other words, symbols are simply
read with case preserved.  Thus, following up on an example above, the
call to <code>(CreateDIBitmap ...)</code> shows up as
<code>(CreateDIBitmap ...)</code> when displayed in a
stack backtrace, or trace output, etc. Further examples show how in a
Modern mode Lisp session, one gets straightforward results:
</p>

<pre id="41">
(quote MyDogSpot)
  <b>RETURNS</b> MyDogSpot
(symbol-name 'MyDogSpot)
  <b>RETURNS</b> "MyDogSpot"
</pre>
<p id="42">
Thus, in Modern mode, one is easily able to use symbols as names for
externally defined case-sensitive identifiers (e.g., foreign functions).
</p>
<p id="43">
As a further example, the Lisp / XML fragment from above can be
greatly simplified by using unescaped symbols to represent XML tags,
and by using the corresponding case-sensitive variable names directly
in Lisp code:
</p>

<pre id="44">
 ;; An XML phone directory processor
 (case (car element)
   ((CompanyOfficer Manager Employee Consultant)
    (with-xml-element (tag (OfficePhone HomePhone SSNumber)
                           &rest content)
        element
      (my-formatted-output content tag
                           OfficePhone HomePhone SSNumber)))
   (Customer ...)
   ...)
</pre>
<p id="45">
The helper <code>with-xml-element</code>
macro is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre id="46">
 (defmacro with-xml-element ((tag (&rest attributes)
                                  &rest contents)
                             element
                             &body body)
   `(destructuring-bind
        ((,tag
          &key ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (x)
                             (list (list x x)))
                         attributes)
          &allow-other-keys)
         ,@contents)
        ,element
      ,@body))
</pre>

<p id="47">
As for <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a>, there
is little need for it at all in Modern mode. In fact, the original
implementation of Modern mode, which predates <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> and even the full ANSI Common
Lisp specification itself by several years, ignored <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> settings because ignoring them
allowed greater ease moving between ANSI mode and Modern mode by
allowing the same <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> settings in both modes. Responding
to user feedback, however, Franz Inc. reconsidered that
decision. Allegro CL now provides full <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> functionality in Modern mode. The
default <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> setting
for Modern mode is <code>:preserve</code>.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="48"><a name="ansi-support-2">1.4 A note on support for ANSI mode</a></h2>

<p id="49">
Franz Inc. is committed to providing fully
ANSI-compliant Common Lisp development and runtime environments.  With
each release, Franz Inc. includes a fully supported ANSI-compliant
Common Lisp executable. As Franz Inc. introduces new features that
extend the ANSI Common Lisp specification, priority is given to ensure
not only that ANSI-compliant Common Lisp code will run, but also that
such new features are as backwards compatible as possible with prior
Franz Inc. releases.
</p>
<p id="50">
Modern mode is provided separately from the backwards compatible ANSI
executable(s) because Modern mode directly contradicts the ANSI
specification in two very specific user-visible ways which can break
ANSI-compliant Common Lisp programs. If you have Allegro CL installed,
you may find, for example, files named <i>alisp.dxl</i>
and <i>mlisp.dxl</i>. These correspond to the base lisp
images for ANSI mode and Modern mode respectively. (Please see
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for information on starting Allegro CL
images.) Windows users may find "ANSI" and "Modern" as Allegro CL
start menu items. Other than the case mode, however, the images are
equivalent.  Users unable to switch to Modern mode can simply stick to
using the ANSI mode versions.
</p>
<p id="51">
In order to increase Common Lisp's effectiveness with modern day,
externally accessible, case-sensitive programming environments, Franz
Inc. is bringing its Modern mode to the fore as a way to encourage
Lisp users and developers to consider new ways of thinking about how
Lisp symbols can be used. In Modern mode, Lisp symbols can easily be
used not only for Lisp function/variable/object names, but also for
external names such as classes/functions in Java/C++, or data elements
in XML or CORBA. Note that it is generally easy to write and maintain
Lisp code which runs in either ANSI or Modern mode.
</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="52"><a name="implementation-1">2.0 Case implementation in Allegro CL</a></h2>

<p id="53">
There are two parameters that determine the reader's actions:
<i>case preference</i> and <i>case sensitivity</i>. The
preferred case is either <i>upper</i> or <i>lower</i>, and refers to
the case of the characters in the print names of all of the standard
symbols, such as <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. Case
sensitivity can be either <i>sensitive</i> or <i>insensitive</i> to
case. Case-sensitive means that the Lisp reader does not modify the
case of any characters it reads. Case-insensitive means that
characters that are not of the preferred case are converted to the
preferred case.
</p>

<p id="54">
Thus, there are four possible values for the combination of case
preference and case sensitivity. However, only three are supported in
Allegro CL.
</p>

<ul>
<li id="55">
<i>Case-insensitive, uppercase-preferred</i>. This is the mode 
used in standard Common Lisp and in most of the older Lisps 
such as MacLisp. With this mode you can even enter Lisp 
programs with a card punch. This is the most portable mode. 
</li>
<li id="56">
<i>Case-sensitive, uppercase-preferred</i>. This is the mode 
used by InterLisp and the mode that <strong>Allegro CL no longer 
supports</strong>.
</li>
<li id="57">
<i>Case-insensitive, lowercase-preferred</i>. This mode is similar 
to the case-insensitive, uppercase-preferred mode. This mode 
is useful if you are reading files designed for a case-insensitive 
Lisp into a case-sensitive, lowercase preferred Lisp.
</li>
<li id="58">
<i>Case-sensitive, lowercase-preferred</i>. This is the mode 
used by many modern languages, including, for example, the C 
programming language. It matches the conventions of Unix and thus 
is the most natural mode to use for some programmers. 
</li>
</ul>


<p id="59">
The functions <a href="operators/excl/set-case-mode.htm"><b>set-case-mode</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/convert-mixed-case-symbols.htm"><b>convert-mixed-case-symbols</b></a>, and two variables
<a href="variables/excl/s_current-case-mode_s.htm"><code>*current-case-mode*</code></a>
and <a href="variables/excl/s_ignore-package-name-case_s.htm"><code>*ignore-package-name-case*</code></a> are provided for
controlling and sensing case modes.
</p>

<p id="60">
So, Allegro Common Lisp can operate in three different case modes, two
of which, modern (case-sensitive lower) and ANSI (case-insensitive
upper) are the more important and treated in detail in this document.
</p>


<hr><hr><h2 id="61"><a name="readtable-case-1">3.0 readtable-case</a></h2>

<p id="62">
The ANSI specification does, in fact, address limited case-sensitivity
by providing <em>readtable-case</em> functionality. The function
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtab0.htm"><b>readtable-case</b></a> accesses (and
with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> sets) the
readtable-case of a readtable object.  Franz Inc. fully supports this
readtable-case functionality in both ANSI and Modern modes.  
</p>
<p id="63">
While the ANSI readtable-case solution may be suitable for programmers
wishing to use ANSI mode yet still requiring a case-sensitive reader,
this functionality is somewhat counterintuitive due to ANSI
limitations.  Specifically, the only readtable-case setting which can
effectively be used that doesn't require all source code to be
converted to upper case and which still provides case-sensitivity is
the <i>:invert</i> setting.  The way this setting works is by having
the Lisp symbol reader turn symbol names with all lower case
characters into all upper case and vice versa.
</p>
<p id="64">
For those not already aware of the interaction between <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> and the
<code>:invert</code> readtable-case, ANSI mode Common Lisp can
create some surprising results. For example, a symbol whose name is
"ZEBRA" is printed in <i>all lower case</i> even when <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> is specified to be
<code>:upcase</code>. Also, the symbol whose name is "Zebra" is
printed as 'Zebra' (i.e., <i>capitalized</i>) even if <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> is either
<code>:upcase</code> or <code>:downcase</code>.  While
these results are understandable, given how the reader and printer
must operate with the ANSI specified case mode, they are not
intuitive.  On the other hand, the Allegro CL case modes, the Modern
mode in particular, provide a direct way of dealing with reading and
printing case-sensitive symbols.
</p>
<p id="65">
For each case mode, the initial case settings for readtable-case are
summarized in the following table:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>mode</th>
<th>initial symbol-name storage</th>
<th>readtables cases</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>:case-insensitive-upper</code> (ANSI)</td>
<td>uppercase</td>
<td><code>:upcase</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>:case-sensitive-lower</code> (Modern)</td>
<td>lowercase</td>
<td><code>:preserve</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>:case-insensitive-lower</code></td>
<td>lowercase</td>
<td><code>:downcase</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p id="66">
A call to <a href="operators/excl/set-case-mode.htm"><b>set-case-mode</b></a>
resets to the corresponding value in the table above the
readtable-case of the Lisp standard readtable as well as all existing
readtables except those whose readtable-case has been explicitly set.
In other words, the default situation is that a readtable's
<nobr>readtable-case</nobr> will be updated by <a href="operators/excl/set-case-mode.htm"><b>set-case-mode</b></a>. If you have used <b>setf</b> to
modify a readtable's readtable-case to one of the ANSI-specified
settings, then that readtable's readtable-case is <i>not</i> changed
by subsequent calls to <a href="operators/excl/set-case-mode.htm"><b>set-case-mode</b></a> unless/until that readtable-case
is set to <code>:default</code>.  Specifically, for any
readtable <i>rt</i>, evaluating
</p>
<pre id="67">
(setf (readtable-case rt) :default)
</pre>
<p id="68">
sets <i>rt</i>'s readtable-case to the value according to the current
case mode as specified by the above table.  Furthermore, unless the
<i>rt</i>'s readtable-case is later set to a value other than
:default, <i>rt</i>'s readtable-case is automatically adjusted by
future calls to <a href="operators/excl/set-case-mode.htm"><b>set-case-mode</b></a>.

<p id="70">
In general, Common Lisp programs which don't depend on
case-sensitivity, and which are written using lower case for
pre-defined Lisp names will work either in Modern mode or in ANSI
mode.  Code which works in both ANSI mode and Modern mode
is called <b>case-portable</b> code.
</p>
<p id="71">
There are a few areas that programmers must look for when developing
code that is to be case-portable, that is compatible between both
Modern and ANSI modes (and portable to other conforming Common Lisp
implementations).
</p>
<p id="72">
Specifically, places where literal upper case strings are used as
string designators can portably be replaced by symbols. For example,
the following form works only in ANSI mode:
</p>

<pre id="73">
 (in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER")
</pre>

<p id="74">
If the string designator is changed to be a symbol, then the form
will work in both ANSI and Modern modes (and is portable to other
conforming Common Lisp implementations):

<pre id="75">
 (in-package :common-lisp-user)

<p id="76">
Both <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/in-packa.htm"><b>in-package</b></a>

<p id="77">
Some functions may deal with symbol-names directly in other ways.
Again, these can also be made compatible between ANSI and Modern modes
by using symbols (often keywords) as string designators. For example,
the following form works only in ANSI mode:

which are documented only indirectly in <a href="cgide.htm#nocg-winapp-1">cgide.htm</a>, have mixed-case symbol names
like <code>CreateWindowEx</code>. Unlike in releases prior to
9.0, these names do not generally have single-case equivalents in an
ANSI Lisp unless specifically documented. This change was made to ease
portability between ANSI and Modern code.
</p>
<p id="83">
That package is the only one in Allegro CL where mixed-case symbols
name operators.

<hr><h2 id="84"><a name="package-names-2">4.1 Package names</a></h2>

<p id="85">
Packages are named by strings and are looked up in a case sensitive
manner. In Modern mode the standard package names are all in lower
case and in ANSI mode they are in upper case. Thus a good way to
refer to package is not by a string e.g.  "common-lisp-user"
but by a symbol such as <code>:common-lisp-user</code> or
<code>#:common-lisp-user</code>. Putting the symbol in the keyword
package or using an uninterned-symbol keeps from cluttering the
current package (and maybe causing symbol clashes).
</p>

<p id="86">
Symbols can be used nearly everywhere a package name is needed. The
functions that look for package names use the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/symbol-n.htm"><b>symbol-name</b></a> of a symbol passed as an argument.
By doing
</p>

<pre id="87">
(in-package :ole)
</pre>

<p id="88">
you end up calling <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/in-packa.htm"><b>in-package</b></a> with "ole" in Modern
mode or "OLE" in ANSI mode, and thus the package is
found regardless of the mode.
</p>

<p id="89">
A global solution to matching package names is to set the variable
<a href="variables/excl/s_ignore-package-name-case_s.htm"><code>*ignore-package-name-case*</code></a>.  When the value of
that variable is true, package name to package lookup is done in a
case insensitive manner.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="90"><a name="package-definitions-2">4.2 Package definitions</a></h2>

<p id="91">
In package definitions you also want to use symbols in place of
strings, as in:
</p>

<pre id="92">(defpackage :foreign-functions 
      (:nicknames :ff) 
      (:use :common-lisp :excl) 
      (:export #:def-foreign-call 
               #:def-foreign-type
               #:defun-foreign-callable 
               #:def-foreign-variable ))</pre>



<hr><h2 id="93"><a name="creating-symbols-2">4.3 Creating symbols</a></h2>

<p id="94">
The most common non-compatible form we come across looks like this
</p>

<pre id="95">
(defun constructor (struct) 
  (intern (format nil "MAKE-~a" struct)))
</pre>

<p id="96">
This assumes that this code will run in ANSI mode. Writing it as
follows allows the case of the <i>make-</i> symbol and the struct
argument to be determined by the case of the symbols' symbol-names,
which will be correct for the case mode:
</p>

<pre id="97">
(defun constructor (struct) 
  (intern (format nil "~a~a" 
            (symbol-name :make-) (string struct))))
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="98"><a name="testing-symbols-2">4.4 Testing symbols</a></h2>

<p id="99">
When reading and testing against symbol names you'll want the code to
work regardless of the case of the print names. This can be
accomplished by using case-insensitive predicates (such as <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/equalp.htm"><b>equalp</b></a>). Another possibility is to use
<code>(string :foo)</code> rather than "foo" or
"FOO" so that the correct string for the current case mode
is used at runtime.
</p>

<p id="101">
Generally ANSI mode code can be made compatible by looking for
and fixing the few items we've mentioned above. However you may
encounter code written in a style such as this:
</p>

<pre id="102">
(DeFun Foo (x y)
      (Cond ((PlusP x) (Sqrt y)) 
            (t y)))
</pre>

<p id="103">The author of this code is taking advantage of the fact that in
ANSI mode the case of symbols in the source code doesn't matter. In
order to port this to Modern mode you could go through and lowercase
every symbol naming an official Lisp form. The author of the code is
unlikely to want the code back after such a transformation, as he must
see some value to his style of capitalization. A way to make this code
readable into Modern mode Lisp without modifying it is to switch the Lisp
to <code>:case-insensitive-lower</code> mode. In this mode, the
strange symbol names will be downcased. After reading in this file the
mode can be switched back to <code>:case-sensitive-lower</code>
mode.
</p>

<p id="104">
Note that when you switch to
<code>:case-insensitive-lower</code> mode the value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> determines how
symbols will be printed. The initial value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> is <code>:upcase</code>. Thus
unless you change <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> you'll find that when you switch to
<code>:case-insensitive-lower</code>, symbols will start
printing in upper case even though their print names are in lower
case. If this annoys you, you can set <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ca.htm"><code>*print-case*</code></a> to
<code>:downcase</code>.

<p id="106">
Import can mean two things: (1) compiling and loading source files,
and (2) loading fasl (compiled) files. Obviously, if you have the
sources, you can make modifications when you encounter
difficulties. When you only have fasl files, modifications are harder
to impossible but some potential problems go away.
</p>
<p id="107">
Please note that importation may not be possible. Particularly if the
suggestions in <a href="#portability-1">Section 4.0 ANSI/Modern code portability</a> are not
followed, the sources must be modified and likely the fasl files
simply will not work (they may load but the code will likely error
when run).
</p>
<p id="108">
The macro <a href="operators/excl/in-case-mode.htm"><b>in-case-mode</b></a> is
designed to facilitate loading files compiled in one mode into the
other mode. (It does not deal with the case-insensitive, lowercase
preferred mode.) See the description of that macro for further information.
