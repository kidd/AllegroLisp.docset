<h3 id="3">
Class 
</h3>
<p id="4">
The class of a horizontal-scroll-bar control. Note this is unrelated
to scrollbars placed in certain windows automatically by the system.
</p>
<h3 id="5">
Control
</h3>
<p id="6">
An instance of the :horizontal-scrollbar class. This control is paired
programmatically with other controls (static pictures, for instance)
to permit horizontal scrolling when too much information prevents the
viewer from seeing everything on their display simultaneously.
</p>
<p id="7">
Scrollbars can also be used as sliders to affect another control by
raising or lowering a number, intensifying or fading a color, or
otherwise gradually increasing/decreasing some characteristic of the
attached control. A good model of this appears in the Car Payments
Example in the Examples tab of the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator dialog</a> (display
with <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/help-menu.htm#examples">Help | CG Examples</a>).
</p>
<p id="8">
The <a href="../../operators/cg/r/range.htm"><b>range</b></a>
property of the scrollbar is a list of two integers: for example, (0
100). The value of the scrollbar determines the position of the
scrollbox along the length of the scrollbar.  The value of the
scrollbar is an integer within the range.
</p>
<p id="9">
The <a href="../../operators/cg/d/delayed.htm"><b>delayed</b></a> property controls
whether the scrollbar's value is updated as the user scrolls or only
at the end of the scrolling operation.
</p>
<p id="10">
See the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator
dialog</a> example (on the Examples tab) entitled "Car Payments"
for an example of basic usage of scroll-bar widgets.
</p>
<h3 id="11">
Adding a horizontal-scroll-bar control to your form
</h3>
<p id="12">
Click the horizontal-scroll-bar icon on of the Component toolbar. Move
the mouse cursor to the part of the form where you want to place the
control, and click again. The control will appear with colored
resizing handles.
</p>
<h3 id="13">
Resizing and moving the control
</h3>
<p id="14">
Controls can only be resized and moved on forms during the design
stage; the size and location of everything is fixed on a running form.
</p>
<p id="15">
Resize the control by clicking the mouse cursor and dragging one of
the handles to the new size-point. Release the mouse key when you are
satisfied with the new size.
</p>
<p id="16">
Move the control by clicking anywhere on it except a resizing handle
and dragging it to a new location on the form. Release the mouse key
when you are ready to place the control.
</p>
<h3 id="17">
Customizing the horizontal-scrollbar
</h3>
<p id="18">
Attaching a scrollbar to another control. Scrollbars are not attached
to other controls (as the up-down-control is, e.g.) You have to
customize the <a href="../../operators/cg/o/on-change.htm"><b>on-change</b></a> (typically) event handler
for the scrollbar to programmatically make whatever scrolling effect
you want.
</p>
<p id="19">
Attaching a scrollbar to a window. Scrollbars on windows and various
components such as <a href="multi-line-editable-text.htm"><code>multi-line-editable-text</code></a> or <a href="outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> are
implemented differently. They are added when needed when the <a href="../../operators/cg/s/scrollbars.htm"><b>scrollbars</b></a>
property is true.
</p>
<h3 id="20">
Scrolling by logical objects rather than by pixels
</h3>
<p id="21">
In a typical custom scrolling scheme, an application does not need to
worry about how much data is above the current scroll position, and so
the <a href="../../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method can simply
start drawing whatever is known to be currently scrolled to the top of
the window. This means that the application does not have to compute
and/or cache the pixel sizes of everything above the <a href="../../operators/cg/s/scroll-position.htm"><b>scroll-position</b></a>, which simplifies
the coding and can also speed scrolling up quite a bit when there is a
huge amount of data to be scrolled.  The drawbacks are that (1) this
approach may be applicable only if data is entirely arranged into
"rows" or "columns", (2) scrolling is not as visually smooth since an
individual data object is always aligned with the top and/or left side
of the window, and (3) custom methods need to be written to override
several CG generic functions that are exported for this purpose.
</p>
<p id="22">
See the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator
dialog</a> example (on the Examples tab) entitled "Scrolling by
arbitrary objects rather than pixels" for a complete example of this
special alternative for custom scrolling by logical objects..
</p>
<p id="23">
It is now possible to customize scrolling in this way by overriding
the default methods of several generic functions. Typically this is
useful for scrolling by some sort of logical objects such as lines of
text or grid cells rather than by pixels, as the default methods do.
The generic functions that may need to be modified are:
</p>
<p id="24">
<a href="../../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>
to decide what should be drawn based on a custom scroll-position and
then draw it
</p>
<p id="25">
<a href="../../operators/cg/n/nscroll-position.htm"><b>nscroll-position</b></a>
to return a position object where a coordinate might be an index into
a set of arbitrary objects rather than a pixel distance
</p>
<p id="26">
<a href="../../operators/cg/s/scroll-range.htm"><b>scroll-range</b></a>
which may return a value indicating the number of objects to be
scrolled into the window rather than a pixel size
</p>
<p id="27">
<a href="../../operators/cg/u/update-scroll-bars-for-new-window-size.htm"><b>update-scroll-bars-for-new-window-size</b></a>
to adjust the scroll-range after a window has been resized
</p>
<p id="28">
<a href="../../operators/cg/s/scroll-to.htm"><b>scroll-to</b></a> to
interpret a new programmatic scroll position
</p>
<p id="29">
<a href="../../operators/cg/u/user-scroll.htm"><b>user-scroll</b></a> to
interpret an interactive scrolling gesture
</p>
<p id="30">
See <a href="../../cgide.htm#code-creating-controls-1">About how
to get sample code for creating controls</a> in <a href="../../cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>, which explains how to use the
IDE to create such code.
