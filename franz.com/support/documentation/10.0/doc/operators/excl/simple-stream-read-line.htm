<p id="4">
This function implements <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a> for simple-streams.  In addition, it
allows an optional string as a buffer into which to store characters
being read. Unless an EOF is encountered immediately, in which case an
error is signaled or <i>eof-value</i> is returned, the
first return value is a string. If the
<i>given-string</i> is supplied but is <a href="#large-enough">too small</a> to hold the whole line, a new
string of the exact size needed is allocated and returned. (If a new
string is allocated, the contents of a provided
<i>given-string</i> when this function returns are
undefined -- they will likely have been changed in anticipation of the
string being used.)
</p>
<p id="5">
Two values are always returned (following the behavior of <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a>) and a third value is
sometimes returned. The first two return values are:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="6">
<b>The result string, or the eof-value</b>. If an EOF is not
encountered immediately, and if the <i>given-string</i>
is supplied but is <a href="#large-enough">not large enough</a>, this
value will be a newly allocated string large enough to hold the entire
line exactly.
</li>
<li id="7">
<b>A flag indicating why reading stopped</b>: <code>nil</code>, if the line was terminated with a newline; and
<code>t</code> if the line was not terminated with a
newline (that is, the end of file was reached).
</li>
</ol>

<p id="8">
A third value is returned when <i>given-string</i> is <a href="#large-enough">large enough</a> to hold the line read. (No third
value is returned when <i>given-string</i> is not
supplied or when given-string is <a href="#large-enough">too
small</a>). The third value is:
</p>
<ol start="3">
<li id="9">
The number of characters read and stored in
<i>given-string</i>, (which does not include a newline
if read).
</li>
</ol>
<p id="10">
Since you do not typically know in advance whether the
<i>given-string</i> or a new string is returned, the
number of characters read (not counting the newline) is the value of
</p>
<pre id="11">
  (or end (length string))
  ;; END is the third return value, STRING the first
</pre>
<p id="12">
<i>given-string</i> may be simple or non-simple, but
must be a string. The other arguments are as for <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a> (note there is no
<i>recursive-p</i> argument and
<i>stream</i>, <i>eof-error-p</i>, and
<i>eof-value</i> are required, not optional).
</p>

<p id="13">
The motivation for this function is twofold: to provide a direct
implementation for <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a>
for simple-streams, and to provide a tradeoff for consing between that
of <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a> and that of
<a href="read-line-into.htm"><b>excl:read-line-into</b></a> (<a href="read-line-into.htm"><b>excl:read-line-into</b></a> does no consing
but requires more bookkeeping). If the supplied string is large
enough, then most of the time consing will not occur, but for the
occasional larger-than-expected line, the allocation of a string
is automatic.
</p>
<p id="14">
See also <a href="read-line-into.htm"><b>read-line-into</b></a>. That function is more space
efficient than this one, but has a more complicated interface.

<a name="large-enough">How large must the given-string be?</a>
</h3>

<p id="18">
The examples above include a case where the line has 10 characters,
and the <i>given-string</i> is length 10 but it is not
used. Instead, a new string of length 10 is allocated. Why is the
given-string insufficient? The problem is that the most efficient time
to allocate a new string when necessary is to do it when the
<i>given-string</i> is full and there is known to be at
least one more character to read, but before it is known what that
character is. If that additional character turns out to be a newline,
then in fact the <i>given-string</i> was big enough but
by this time the new string is already allocated.
</p>
<p id="19">
Therefore, <i>given-string</i> must be larger than the
anticipated maximum line length in order that it always be used. (For
common external formats, it must be one larger. There may be external
formats where more that one extra character is needed.)
</p>
<p id="20">
This need for a longer given-string than the maximal line length (not
counting the newline) is suboptimal behavior, and may be replaced in a
future release if an efficient implementation can be
discovered. However, as currently implemented, too much extra time
would have to be spent in order to determine whether a line is or is
not exactly as big as the given-string.
