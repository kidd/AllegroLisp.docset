<p id="5">
Icons are like small pixmaps that have a mask, don't stretch, and come
in two standard sizes. Common Graphics applications usually use
pixmaps whenever they need to draw pixelated images, but there are a
couple of special places where icons must be used instead. These
places include the image that appears on the left end of a window's
title-bar, and the image that is used to represent an application in
the Windows taskbar, alt-tab window, and file explorer.
</p>
<p id="6">
These special icon requirements stem directly from the Windows
operating system, and so icons are one Common Graphics facility whose
API is likely to differ in future ports of Common Graphics to
non-Windows platforms.
</p>
<p id="7">
Note that some Common Graphics function names contain the word "icon"
but are not related to Common Graphics icons. These include the
function <a href="../operators/ide/standard-toolbar-icons.htm"><b>standard-toolbar-icons</b></a>, the
list-view function <a href="../operators/cg/i/icon-index.htm"><b>icon-index</b></a> and the outline function
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-icons.htm"><b>draw-icons</b></a>.
"Icon" is used in a more generic way in these cases to refer to a
small image. The functions discussed here refer instead to Common
Graphics icon objects.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="8"><a name="using-built-in-icon-1">2.0 Using a built-in icon</a></h2>

<p id="9">
Common Graphics includes several constants whose values are standard
icons supplied by the operating system. These icons may be used
directly instead of creating custom icons. The constants are <a href="../variables/cg/error-icon.htm"><code>error-icon</code></a>, <a href="../variables/cg/warning-icon.htm"><code>warning-icon</code></a>,
<a href="../variables/cg/question-icon.htm"><code>question-icon</code></a>, <a href="../variables/cg/information-icon.htm"><code>information-icon</code></a>,
and <a href="../variables/cg/application-icon.htm"><code>application-icon</code></a>.
</p>
<p id="10">
Notice that the values of these constants are simply integers. Common
Graphics does not supply an icon class or special lisp objects for
icons; instead they are simply handles that the operating system
uses to look up the desired icon.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="11"><a name="icon-in-title-bar-1">3.0 Assigning an icon to a window title-bar</a></h2>



<p id="12">
Once you have an icon to use, you can add it to a window title-bar by
calling <a href="../operators/cg/i/icon.htm"><b>(setf
icon)</b></a> on the window. This icon will override the default icon
for the whole application (see below).
</p>
<p id="13">
Example: This expression changes the icon in the inspector's title-bar
to a question mark.
</p>
<pre id="14">
(setf (icon (find-window :inspector)) question-icon)
</pre>
<p id="15">
Setting the <a href="../operators/cg/i/icon.htm"><b>icon</b></a>
property to nil will revert to the default icon of the application.
In the IDE this is the Franz bust icon.
</p>
<pre id="16">
(setf (icon (find-window :inspector)) nil)
</pre>


<hr><hr><h2 id="17"><a name="icon-for-control-1">4.0 Assigning an icon to a control</a></h2>


<p id="18">
You can similarly assign an icon to a control, if the control is one
that displays a pixelated image, by calling <a href="../operators/cg/p/pixmap-icon.htm"><b>(setf
pixmap-icon)</b></a>. Icons may be used with the <a href="../classes/cg/static-picture.htm"><code>static-picture</code></a>, <a href="../classes/cg/picture-button.htm"><code>picture-button</code></a>, and
<a href="../classes/cg/multi-picture-button.htm"><code>multi-picture-button</code></a> controls. For
the multi-picture-button control, <a href="../operators/cg/p/pixmap-icon.htm"><b>(setf
pixmap-icon)</b></a> should be called on the individual <a href="../classes/cg/button-info.htm"><code>button-info</code></a> instances
in the control's range, rather than on the control itself. (<a href="../classes/cg/list-view.htm"><code>list-view</code></a>s and <a href="../classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a>s can display
pixmaps but not icons.)
</p>
<p id="19">
There is generally no need to use icons on controls, since pixmaps can
be used instead, but the option is available, and icons may draw
slightly faster than pixmaps with masks. (If the image lives in an
icon file, <a href="../operators/cg/l/load-pixmap.htm"><b>load-pixmap</b></a> may still be used to
create a pixmap for it, so a pixmap may be used in Common Graphics
even for an image that was designed as an icon.)
</p>
<p id="20">
Example: The following form will display the question icon on the
button control near the top left of the inspector.
</p>
<pre id="21">
(setf (pixmap-icon (find-component
                    :back (frame-child (find-window :inspector))))
  question-icon)
</pre>

<p id="22">
Notice that the image is larger than it was for the same icon in the
window title-bar (and in fact does not fit within the button). The
reason is that icons are usually defined at two standard sizes, 16 by
16 pixels and 32 by 32 pixels, which are both referenced by the single
icon handle. When assigning a window title-bar icon, the operating
system always draws the small version in the title-bar, and the large
version in the alt-tab window (for non-owned top-level
windows). Common Graphics always draws the large version on a control.
</p>


<hr><hr><h2 id="23"><a name="creating-an-icon-1">5.0 Creating an icon</a></h2>


<p id="24">
By this point you may have begun to tire of the built-in question mark
icon, delightful though it is. Luckily, the rest of this document
covers custom icons. There are two ways to create a Common Graphics
icon: to load it from a file that defines icons, or to create it from
a Common Graphics pixmap.
</p>
<p id="25">
The typical way to create an icon is to call the function <a href="../operators/cg/e/extract-icon-from-file.htm"><b>extract-icon-from-file</b></a>,
which loads a pre-made icon from a file. The file may be either a .ico
file, which is a type of Windows file intended specifically for
holding an icon, or a .dll file, which can contain a whole library of
icons, or a .exe file. A distributed application that uses <a href="../operators/cg/e/extract-icon-from-file.htm"><b>extract-icon-from-file</b></a>
must include the files from which it loads icons and load them at run
time, since there is no way to embed these icons in the application's
image file or executable file (other than the single icon for the
application itself, as described later). Allegro CL does not provide any
tools for creating icon files, though there are third-party tools for
doing just that.
</p>
<p id="26">
Example: This expression loads the eighth icon from the file
<i>moricons.dll</i> in the Windows system directory
(assuming that this file exists), and displays it in the title-bar of
the inspector.
</p>
<pre id="27">
(setf (icon (find-window :inspector))
  (extract-icon-from-file
    (merge-pathnames "moricons.dll" (windows-directory t))
    8))
</pre>
<p id="28">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/c/count-icons-in-file.htm"><b>count-icons-in-file</b></a> returns the
number of icons in a specified file, so that you can know what indices
make sense to pass to <a href="../operators/cg/e/extract-icon-from-file.htm"><b>extract-icon-from-file</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="29">
The other way to create an icon is to create it from a Common Graphics
pixmap by calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/create-icon-handle.htm"><b>create-icon-handle</b></a>. This technique
is useful if the icon does not live in a .ico, .dll, or .exe file,
since <a href="../operators/cg/e/extract-icon-from-file.htm"><b>extract-icon-from-file</b></a> is not
applicable. It is also useful if it is desirable to not distribute
.ico files with an application; in that case, a pixmap could be
created in lisp (see <a href="cg-pixmaps.htm">cg-pixmaps.htm</a>), and then an
icon made from the pixmap.
</p>
<p id="30">
<a href="../operators/cg/c/create-icon-handle.htm"><b>create-icon-handle</b></a>
creates an icon with a single image, rather than the separate large
and small images that are usually defined in .ico, .dll, and .exe
files. If you intend to use the icon in window title-bars, the size
should be 16 by 16 pixels.
</p>
<p id="31">
Example: The following code defines the function
<b>open-folder-icon</b> to return an icon with an image of an open
file folder. It caches the icon so that this function may be called
whenever the icon is needed, without recreating it each time.
</p>
<p id="32">
Note that it would be a bad idea to instead write a <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defparam.htm"><b>defparameter</b></a> or <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defparam.htm"><b>defvar</b></a> form whose initial value is the icon
returned by a call to <a href="../operators/cg/c/create-icon-handle.htm"><b>create-icon-handle</b></a>.  The reason is
that an icon handle will no longer be valid if used in a different
lisp session than where <a href="../operators/cg/c/create-icon-handle.htm"><b>create-icon-handle</b></a> was called, and
this would happen after generating a standalone application due to the
<a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defparam.htm"><b>defparameter</b></a> initform being
evaluated when generating the application image rather than when
running it. (A pixmap, on the other hand, would work fine if created
in a <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/defparam.htm"><b>defparameter</b></a> initform.)

It is, of course, tedious to define a pixmap as a lisp expression as
above. Such expressions can be obtained, however, by evaluating a form
such as <code>(pprint (recreation-code my-pixmap))</code> and
then pasting the output into your source code (see <a href="../operators/cg/r/recreation-code.htm"><b>recreation-code</b></a>). The pixmap may
originally have lived in a .bmp or .ico file and loaded with
load-pixmap, but this technique allows you to thereafter define the
image completely within lisp and avoid distributing the original .bmp
or .ico file with your application.

<p id="38">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-icon.htm"><b>draw-icon</b></a> will draw an icon at an
arbitrary position in any window. As with assigning an icon to a
control, this is generally not needed since a pixmap that has a mask
could be drawn instead with <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-to-stream.htm"><b>copy-to-stream</b></a> (except for the five
built-in icons). Icons may draw a bit faster than pixmaps with masks.
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-icon.htm"><b>draw-icon</b></a> always
draws the larger size of an icon that defines both icon sizes.
</p>
<p id="39">
Example:  The following expression draws the question mark icon on a
window.
</p>

<pre id="40">

<p id="42">
If you are using the IDE's project system to create an application,
you can use an icon to represent the entire application by calling
<a href="../operators/ide/icon-file.htm"><b>(setf
icon-file)</b></a> on the project. You can do this interactively by
entering the name of a .ico file on the Build tab of the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a> dialog. (Click on the Icon File check box to show the
file dialog for selecting an icon file.) When you later use <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a> | <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">Build Project Distribution</a>
to generate a standalone application and then run it, the windows of
that application will show the small version of the icon in their
title-bars, except where the application may have called <a href="../operators/cg/i/icon.htm"><b>(setf icon)</b></a>
on particular windows to override this default icon. Moreover, the
Windows taskbar and the alt-tab window will show the custom icon
instead of the Franz bust icon, and the Windows file explorer will
show the icon for certain generated files. This particular facility
requires a .ico icon file rather than a Common Graphics icon. There
is no way to save a Common Graphics icon (that may have been created
in lisp) as a .ico icon file. This particular icon is embedded in the
generated executable file that is to be distributed, so there is no
need to distribute the original icon file with the application.
