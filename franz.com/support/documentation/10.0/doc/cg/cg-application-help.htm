This document describes techniques that can be used in Common Graphics
to allow the end user to quickly get help on whatever feature of your
application they happen to be using at any moment. Typically, it's
important to add such context-sensitive help to your application so
that your users are able to easily discover all of the wonderful
features that you have designed and to get quick reminders about
features that they've already learned.
</p><hr><hr><h2 id="5"><a name="displaying-help-1">1.0 Displaying help</a></h2>

<p id="6">
This section describes how to display help once you've decided what to
show help on. Further sections cover how to trigger the displaying of
help and how to decide what to provide help on.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="7"><a name="comprehensive-help-2">1.1 Comprehensive help</a></h2>

<p id="8">
Comprehensive help is useful for initially learning about a feature.
Quick help, covered below, is better for providing quick reminders
about features that have already been learned.  The techniques covered
here for comprehensive help are HTML, WinHelp, and rich text.
</p>

<h3 id="9">HTML</h3>

<p id="10">
A popular and easy way to display comprehensive help is to show it in
a web browser.  In CG, an application can display an HTML file by
simply calling <a href="../operators/cg/i/invoke-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-html-browser</b></a> on a pathname
or namestring of an HTML file that you have prepared.
</p>
<p id="11">
This facility requires either that the end user has established
Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator as their default HTML browser,
or that they are currently running one of those programs. In the
unlikely event that a user does not have either of these browsers,
your app could instruct them to simply download one of them. (You can
detect this case by checking if <a href="../operators/cg/i/invoke-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-html-browser</b></a> returns <code>nil</code>.)
</p>
<p id="12">
Common Graphics tries to expose the HTML browser after it has
displayed the HTML file in it (starting up the default browser if none
is running), though newer versions of Windows prevent exposing a
window in another thread, and instead the browser's button in the
taskbar will flash to tell the user that the browser is asking to be
selected.
</p>
<p id="13">
Allegro does not provide an HTML editor, so it is up to you to create
your HTML files using whatever tool you like.
</p>

<h3 id="14">WinHelp</h3>

<p id="15">
WinHelp is a standard facility for help in Windows programs, though
many people have moved to HTML or XML more recently in order to
maintain their master help data in a less proprietary or more
forward-looking format. If you prefer WinHelp, it can be used in an
Allegro application, though you must call the Windows API function for
this facility directly. You must also use a third-party tool to
construct the WinHelp file to distribute.
</p>
<p id="16">
To invoke WinHelp, you just need to call the function
<b>windows:WinHelp</b>. Below is a sample function that shows how you
can call this Windows API function directly. (The <a href="../operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a> for WinHelp has
already been set up, as with many other Windows API functions that
exist as lisp functions in the "windows" package.)  The function shown
below does not exist in Allegro, but you may use it or something
similar.  To implement additional WinHelp options, refer to
Microsoft's documentation.
</p>

<pre id="17">
(defun windows-help (window winhelp-file topic)
  ;; WINDOW should be any window in your application.
  ;; WINHELP-FILE should be the pathname or namestring of a winhelp file.
  ;; TOPIC should be either a string naming a "key" in the winhelp file,
  ;;   or the symbol :index to display the winhelp file's index,
  ;;   or the symbol :close to close the winhelp window.
  (let* ((key? nil)
         (type (case topic
                 (:index win:HELP_FINDER)
                 (:close win:HELP_QUIT)
                 (t (setq key? t) win:HELP_KEY))))
    (excl:with-native-string (native-path-string (namestring winhelp-file))
      (excl:with-native-string (native-topic-string (if key? topic ""))
        (win:WinHelp (cg:handle window) native-path-string type
                     (if key? native-topic-string 0))))))
</pre>

<p id="18">
Allegro does not provide any tools for creating WinHelp files, so you
need to use other tools to create them.
</p>

<h3 id="19">Rich text</h3>

<p id="20">
Another option is to use rich text.  Common Graphics includes a
<a href="../classes/cg/rich-edit.htm"><code>rich-edit</code></a> widget,
and so displaying help in such a widget allows you to integrate help
anywhere in the window hierarchy of your Common Graphics application,
rather than as a separate top-level HTML browser or WinHelp window
over which your application has less control.  The rich-edit control
does not support multiple columns or pixmaps, but does support such
things as multiple font faces and sizes, colored text, bulleted lists,
and different indentation and justification in each paragraph, which
can go a long way.
</p>
<p id="21">
You can create rich text documents to be read into a Common Graphics
<a href="../classes/cg/rich-edit.htm"><code>rich-edit</code></a>
control either in a word processor such as Word or Wordpad, or in a
Common Graphics rich-edit control.  To try editing rich text in the
IDE, invoke the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a>
| <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#new-form">New
Form</a> command and select <code>rich-edit-dialog</code>
from the list of window types. Running this form allows you to start
editing rich text immediately.
</p>
<p id="22">
A non-standard rich text feature that Common Graphics provides is the
ability to add colored hypertext links to a rich text document (see
find-links), similar to HTML links.  You will need to use a Common
Graphics <a href="../classes/cg/rich-edit-dialog.htm"><code>rich-edit-dialog</code></a> to add the links,
rather than a third-party word processor.
</p>
<p id="23">
See <a href="cg-rich-text.htm">cg-rich-text.htm</a> for an introduction
to Common Graphics's rich text functionality.
</p>





<hr><h2 id="24"><a name="quick-help-2">1.2 Quick help</a></h2>

<p id="25">
Common Graphics makes it easy to display quick reminders to the user
either as status-bar messages or as tooltips.
</p>

<h3 id="26">Status bar messages</h3>

<p id="27">
A status bar is a narrow area along the bottom of a window into which
short messages can be displayed. Common Graphics offers two types of
status bars:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="28">
The <a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a> class implements
a status bar provided by the operating system. It can have multiple
sections with borders between them, and has a border that matches the
current style of the OS (including a large resizing handle at the
right end). It can display only a single line of text.
</li>
<li id="29">
The <a href="../classes/cg/status-bar.htm"><code>status-bar</code></a>
class implements a status bar completely within Common Graphics. It
cannot have multiple sections, but can have multiple lines of text.
Since it is usually best to keep status-bar messages as concise as
possible, the <a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a> is recommended
unless multi-line messages are really needed.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="30">
When designing a form interactively, you can add a status bar to any
window by toggling the window's <a href="../operators/cg/s/status-bar.htm"><b>status-bar</b></a> property in the
inspector. The resulting status bar will always be a <a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a>.
Call <a href="../operators/cg/a/add-common-status-bar.htm"><b>add-common-status-bar</b></a> to add a
<a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a> programmatically,
or <a href="../operators/cg/a/add-status-bar.htm"><b>add-status-bar</b></a>
if the multi-line model is preferred.
</p>
<p id="31">
You can display text in a status bar at run time by calling either
<a href="../operators/cg/s/status-bar-message.htm"><b>status-bar-message</b></a> (passing in the
status bar itself) or <a href="../operators/cg/w/window-message.htm"><b>window-message</b></a> (passing in the
window that the status-bar is on; this is typically more convenient).
Calling <a href="../operators/cg/p/parts.htm"><b>(setf
parts)</b></a> on a <a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a> will divide it
into sections for multiple short messages.
</p>

<h3 id="32">Tooltips</h3>

<p id="33">
A tooltip window is a small window that pops up momentarily, usually
as a reminder of what an interface component does.
</p>
<p id="34">
A tooltip can be implemented for any control (dialog-item) by simply
setting its <a href="../operators/cg/t/tooltip.htm"><b>tooltip</b></a> property to an appropriate
short string. The built-in behavior of Common Graphics will cause a
small tooltip window to appear when the mouse cursor has been over the
control for a short time. You can customize this default behavior by
modifying configuration options such as <a href="../operators/cg/s/show-tooltips.htm"><b>show-tooltips</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/t/tooltip-delay.htm"><b>tooltip-delay</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/t/tooltip-vertical-offset.htm"><b>tooltip-vertical-offset</b></a>.
</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="35"><a name="triggering-help-1">2.0 Triggering help</a></h2>

<p id="36">
The preceding section covered how to display help in various ways.
This section covers how to enable the user to invoke help. This can
be done either automatically, where a gesture that a user is making
for some other reason is also used to display help, or on request,
where the user makes an explicit request for help.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="37"><a name="automatic-triggering-2">2.1 Triggering help automatically</a></h2>

<h3 id="38">On tooltip delay</h3>

<p id="39">
When using tooltips, there is nothing you need to do to trigger
showing the tooltip window, since the tooltips facility handles this
for you.
</p>
<p id="40">
But if you would like to show additional help at the time that a
tooltip is triggered, you can add a <a href="../operators/cg/s/show-tooltip.htm"><b>show-tooltip</b></a> method, which will
always be called at this time. Be sure not to overwrite the existing
primary method on dialog-item, though, since that would disable all
tooltips. For example, the following :after method would display the
name and the help-string property of a control in the status-bar of
control's parent window (if it has one) at the same time that the
tooltip window appears. (The IDE uses a similar method, but it is not
built into a Common Graphics app unless you add such a method
yourself.)
</p>

<pre id="41">
(defmethod show-tooltip :after ((control dialog-item))
  (window-message (parent control)
    "~a --- ~a" (name control)(or (help-string control)
                                  "MISSING HELP STRING")))
</pre>

<p id="42">
Note that <a href="../operators/cg/s/show-tooltip.htm"><b>show-tooltip</b></a> is called even when
the control has no tooltip, so the above method will display
status-bar help after the mouse cursor pauses briefly over a control
even if it has no tooltip.
</p>
<p id="43">
Note also that Common Graphics does not make any use of the <a href="../operators/cg/h/help-string.htm"><b>help-string</b></a> property of
controls itself; it is simply provided as a handy hook where you can
place help strings to display whenever and however you like.
Typically a <a href="../operators/cg/h/help-string.htm"><b>help-string</b></a> is displayed in a
status bar, and is longer than a tooltip.
</p>

<h3 id="44">On entering a window or widget</h3>

<p id="45">
To trigger help when the mouse cursor moves into a control or window,
an <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-mouse-in.htm"><b>on-mouse-in</b></a>
event-handler can be added to a control, or a <a href="../operators/cg/m/mouse-in.htm"><b>mouse-in</b></a> method can be written for
a window class
or a <a href="../classes/cg/hotspot.htm"><code>hotspot</code></a>
class. This allows triggering help immediately rather than after the
tooltip pause. This technique can also be applied to arbitrary
windows and to hotspots rather than to controls only.
</p>
<p id="46">
The following example would show a status bar message whenever the
mouse moves into a window.
</p>

<pre id="47">
(defmethod mouse-in :after ((window basic-pane) buttons mouse-out-object)
  (window-message *my-main-window*
    "Moving from ~a into ~a." (name mouse-out-object)(name window)))
</pre>

<h3 id="48">On highlighting a menu-item</h3>

<p id="49">
The generic function <a href="../operators/cg/m/menu-item-highlighted.htm"><b>menu-item-highlighted</b></a> is called
whenever the user moves the mouse over a menu-item to highlight it.
You can add a <a href="../operators/cg/m/menu-item-highlighted.htm"><b>menu-item-highlighted</b></a> method to
display help on the menu-item at this time. Built-in methods will
display the <a href="../operators/cg/h/help-string.htm"><b>help-string</b></a> of a menu-item in the
status-bar of the menu's owner window if there is a status-bar there.
If you'd prefer to show some other sort of help on menu-items, then
you can override the built-in <a href="../operators/cg/m/menu-item-highlighted.htm"><b>menu-item-highlighted</b></a> methods.
</p>

<h3 id="50">On changing a value in a control</h3>

<p id="51">
It may be useful to display status bar messages when the value of a
control changes. This can be done easily by adding a call to <a href="../operators/cg/w/window-message.htm"><b>window-message</b></a> in the
<a href="../operators/cg/o/on-change.htm"><b>on-change</b></a>
functions of the controls. This is especially useful for controls such
as a <a href="../classes/cg/single-item-list.htm"><code>single-item-list</code></a> and <a href="../classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> that list options
that a user can click on in order to see the help string for each one
before committing to any particular choice.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="52"><a name="trigger-on-request-2">2.2 Triggering help on request</a></h2>

<p id="53">
You can add menu commands, global keyboard shortcuts, or buttons
that the user can use to invoke help explicitly.
</p>

<h3 id="54">Menu-bar commands (with F1 as a keyboard shortcut)</h3>

<p id="55">
The standard way to allow users to explicitly request help is to add
one or more menu-items to the application's menu-bar, typically on a
Help menu at the right end of the menu-bar.  And a convention in
Windows is that the keyboard shortcut for the most basic help command
in the application is the F1 key.  Specify the :event-synonym initarg
to <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> as the symbol
<a href="../variables/cg/vk-f1.htm"><code>vk-f1</code></a> when
creating a menu-item to give it this keyboard shortcut.
</p>

<h3 id="56">Shortcut pop-up menus</h3>

<p id="57">
Help commands can also be added to pop-up menus. A convention in
Windows is to add commands for quick access to a pop-up-menu invoked
by clicking the right mouse button in the interior of a window. This
can be implemented in a general way by adding a <a href="../operators/cg/m/mouse-right-down.htm"><b>mouse-right-down</b></a> method that calls
<a href="../operators/cg/o/open-menu.htm"><b>open-menu</b></a> and
<a href="../operators/cg/p/pop-up-menu.htm"><b>pop-up-menu</b></a>. Or
using <a href="../operators/cg/s/shortcut-commands.htm"><b>shortcut-commands</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/p/pop-up-shortcut-menu.htm"><b>pop-up-shortcut-menu</b></a> may
be somewhat more convenient for typical shortcut menus.
</p>

<h3 id="58">Global keyboard accelerators</h3>

<p id="59">
If your application includes top-level windows that are not children
of your main top-level window that has a menu-bar, then you may want
to add global keyboard accelerators for help commands that should
always be available. See <a href="../operators/cg/a/add-global-keyboard-accelerator.htm"><b>add-global-keyboard-accelerator</b></a>.
</p>

<h3 id="60">context-sensitive-help methods</h3>

<p id="61">
An alternative to adding an explicit menu-item or global keyboard
accelerator for the common F1 gesture for context-sensitive help is to
add one or more <a href="../operators/cg/c/context-sensitive-help.htm"><b>context-sensitive-help</b></a> methods.
That generic function is called whenever the user presses the F1 key,
and also when the user uses the question mark button on the title-bar
of a window that has been given the <a href="../operators/cg/h/help-button.htm"><b>help-button</b></a> property.
</p>

<h3 id="62">Buttons</h3>

<p id="63">
Another option, of course, is to have a simple button control on each
dialog whose title is Help and which invokes help on the dialog that
it is on. Just add an <a href="../operators/cg/o/on-change.htm"><b>on-change</b></a> event-handler to the
button that invokes the appropriate help.
</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="64"><a name="where-provide-help-1">3.0 Deciding what to provide help on</a></h2>

<p id="65">
When the user invokes a general command that asks for help on the
current context, you must decide what object they want contextual help
on. This is typically the dialog or other window that they are
currently working in, or perhaps the currently selected application
value in that window. The first two commands in the IDE's Help menu,
for example, provide options for those two cases.
</p>


<hr><h2 id="66"><a name="selected-window-help-2">3.1 Help on the selected window</a></h2>

<p id="67">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-window.htm"><b>selected-window</b></a> can be called to
find what window the user is currently working in. It may be first
called on the screen to find which top-level window is selected, or
you may know that already (either by keeping your main window in a
global variable or by noting the owner window of the menu that was
invoked).  If this top-level window is just a container for other more
interesting windows, calling <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-window.htm"><b>selected-window</b></a> on that window will
tell you what child window is selected within it.
</p>
<p id="68">
An alternative is to call <a href="../operators/cg/g/get-focus.htm"><b>get-focus</b></a>, typically as
<code>(get-focus (screen *system*))</code>, to directly ask
which child window has the keyboard focus.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="69"><a name="selected-object-help-2">3.2 Help on the selected data object</a></h2>

<p id="70">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-object.htm"><b>selected-object</b></a> (or related
functions such as <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-symbol.htm"><b>selected-symbol</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-class.htm"><b>selected-class</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-string.htm"><b>selected-string</b></a>) may be
used to find the application value that is considered to be selected
currently in a control or window. When called on a control, the
built-in methods will likely return a usable value. There are no
built-in methods for non-control windows, but an application can write
a <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-object.htm"><b>selected-object</b></a>
method for any window to return a value in some application-specific
way.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="71"><a name="example-of-help-1">4.0 An example of providing help</a></h2>

<p id="72">
The remainder of this document is a basic example that illustrates
many of the points covered above.  It displays a window with a <a href="../classes/cg/menu-bar.htm"><code>menu-bar</code></a>, a <a href="../classes/cg/common-status-bar.htm"><code>common-status-bar</code></a>, and a
<a href="../classes/cg/single-item-list.htm"><code>single-item-list</code></a> control.  Choosing

<hr><hr><h2 id="75"><a name="unexpected-error-1">5.0 Dealing with an unexpected error in an application</a></h2>

<p id="76">
If an unexpected error is signaled while your application is running,
it is preferable that it be handled so that minimal user data is lost
and the chance of recovery is maximized. The app property
default-error-handler-for-delivery allows you to specify a function
that will be called, with the signaled condition as an argument, that
can deal with the error (although exiting the program after attempting
to save data and collect useful debugging information is often the
only reasonable action).
</p>
<p id="77">
See the description of the property for more details. The defaul
function simply displays a dialog that tells the user an unexpected
error has occurred and exits Lisp.
