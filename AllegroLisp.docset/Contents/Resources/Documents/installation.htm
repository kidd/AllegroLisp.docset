Allegro CL 10.0 is provided in two versions on those platforms which
support SMP: an SMP version which can use more than one hardware
processor at a time and a non-SMP version which (like all versions of
Allegro CL prior to 9.0) uses only one processor. These two versions
have separate downloads: that is you download and install each
individually. Please also note:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="5">
<b>SMP is not available on Solaris and FreeBsd 32-bit</b>. SMP is supported
on Windows, Linux, and macOS and FreeBSD 64-bit.
</li>
<li id="6">
<b>Common Graphics, the IDE, and CLIM are only available in the
non-SMP version of Allegro CL 10.0, on Windows, Linux, and the Mac.</b>
</li>
<li id="7">
If you intend to use the SMP version, please look
at <a href="smp.htm">smp.htm</a>. Note that Lisp code which runs
correctly in the non-SMP version may fail (often by producing
incorrect results rather than erroring) in the SMP version if, for
example, separate processes try to simultaneously modify stored values.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="8">
For each distribution, the installation process of Allegro CL 10.0 is
similar to installation of previous versions of Allegro CL such as
Allegro CL 9.0. Mac users should note that the various tools relating
to running X (such as Xquartz) may need to be installed or
reinstalled.

<hr><hr><h2 id="9"><a name="install-intro-1">1.0 Installation introduction</a></h2>


<p id="10">
This document describes how to install Allegro CL and related
products. 
</p>
<p id="11">
Allegro CL is downloaded. Customers receive instructions on
how to download Allegro CL
10.0 over
the net. Express users download their copy from the Franz Inc. web
site (<a href="http://franz.com">franz.com</a>).  
</p>

<p id="12">
You can install Allegro CL from the download without any
key or code (though you need a license file, as described below, in
order to use Allegro CL).  Once Allegro CL is installed, the
documentation, including this file, is available in the
<i>doc/</i> subdirectory (this file is
<i>doc/installation.htm</i>). A copy of this file is
also available on the Franz Inc. web site (<a href="http://franz.com">franz.com</a>).
</p>
<p id="13">
All types (Professional, Enterprise, etc.) of Allegro CL for a
particular platform and all add-on products are downloaded onto your
computer. A license file named <i>devel.lic</i> controls
which products will be usable. This license file is supplied
separately, as described in
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>. <b>Allegro CL will not
work without a license file properly installed in the Allegro
directory. The download does not contain a license file. You must
obtain a license file from Franz Inc. separately from the
download.</b>
</p>
<p id="14">
If you do not have a license file or the license file you have does
not seem to license the correct product mix, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for information. (If that link does not work, call
Franz Inc. in California, USA, at +1 510-452-2000 or send email
to <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@franz.com">info@franz.com</a>. In email, be sure to
identify yourself and provide information on how you can be
contacted.)
</p>
<p id="15">
Once you have installed Allegro CL and the license file is in place,
you can use the licensed Allegro CL version and all licensed add-on
products. If you upgrade your Allegro CL version, or purchase a
license for an add-on product, you will be given an updated license
file. You do not have to download further material (except in rare
instances or when you have obtained a license for another
platform). Simply installing the new license file makes the newly
licensed products available for use.

you are directed back here from that section. In that case, skip down
to step 3.
</p>


<p id="44">
Here are the installation steps in brief:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="45">
<b>Get the license file</b>. See
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>. You can install
without getting a license file but you cannot use the product without
a license file. 
</li>
<li id="46">
<b>Download the software</b>. You should have received instructions
for downloading from Franz Inc. If not, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for information. (If that link does not work, call
Franz Inc. in California, USA, at +1 510-452-2000 or send email to <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@franz.com">info@franz.com</a>. In email, be sure to
identify yourself and provide information on how you can be
contacted.) We assume below you download the software into
<b>/usr/tmp/</b> on UNIX and <b>C:\\tmp\\</b> on Windows.
<p id="47">
<b>On UNIX (including Linux and macOS)</b>: you
download two files,
<b>acl100.bz2</b> (<b>acl100express-[platform].bz2</b> for the Express
edition (except on the Mac, where only the dmg file is available)
and <b>acl100student-[platform].bz2</b> for the Student edition)
and <b>bunzip2</b>. (The [platform] is freebsd or linux-x85 of
macosx-x86.) On macOS, you also download a <b>.dmg</b> file. You
can install using the <b>.bz2</b> file as described here or using
the <b>.dmg</b> file as
described <a href="#macosx-install-1">Section 6.0 Installation on macOS</a> (Allegro
Express users must follow that link).
</p>
<p id="48">
On Windows, you download one file,
<b>acl100.exe</b> (<b>acl100express-x86.exe</b> for the express edition).
</p>


</li>
<li id="49">
<b>UNIX (including Linux and macOS</b>): cd into the
directory where the software was downloaded.  On Solaris, for example,
if you downloaded into <b>/usr/tmp/</b>

<pre id="50">
% cd /usr/tmp/
</pre>
<p id="51">
See <a href="#install-unix-1">Section 4.0 Notes for installation of Allegro CL on UNIX (including Linux)</a> for more details.
</p>
<p id="52">
<b>Windows</b>: find the download executable file in your Windows
Explorer.
</p>
<p id="53">
<b>macOS</b>: you can use the .dmg file -- go
to <a href="#macosx-install-1">Section 6.0 Installation on macOS</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="54">
<b>Decide where you wish to install the Allegro Directory.</b>
On UNIX, the typical location is
<i>/usr/local/acl100/</i> (<i>/usr/local/acl100express/</i> for the Express
Edition and <i>/usr/local/acl100student/</i> for the Student
Edition). On Windows, the typical
location is <i>C:/acl100/</i>
(<i>C:/acl100-express/</i> for the Express
Edition and <i>&gt;C:/acl100-student/</i> for the Student
Edition). On macOS, the location is <i>AllegroCL</i> (for 32-bit) and
<i>AllegroCL64</i> (for 64-bit).
However, you can
choose any location you like.

</li>
<li id="55">
<b>UNIX: uncompress and untar the distribution file.</b>
The command is (using the typical location)
<pre id="56">
% ./bunzip2 &lt; acl100.bz2 | (cd /usr/local; tar xf -)
</pre>
<p id="57">
For the Express and Student editions, the bz2 filename has
express-[platform] and student-[platform] appended.
</p>

<p id="58">
See <a href="#install-unix-1">Section 4.0 Notes for installation of Allegro CL on UNIX (including Linux)</a> for more details
on this step.
</p>

<p id="59">
<b>Windows: run the exe file</b>. Double click on it if using the
Windows Explorer or execute it if at a Command Prompt. Follow the
instructions that appear. See
<a href="#install-windows-1">Section 5.0 Installation on Windows</a> for full details.
</p>


</li>

<li id="60">
<b>Copy the license file into [Allegro directory]/devel.lic</b>.  The
license file you obtained in step one above should be copied into the

<p id="78">
The Ubuntu Linux operating system, starting with release 14.04,
stopped supplying the 32-bit libraries needed by 32-bit Allegro CL,
including Allegro CL Express Edition. While 32-bit Allegro CL did
continue to work in some cases, particularly when users upgraded to
Ubuntu 14.04 (rather than installing it form scratch), we could not
figure out a way to ensure in all cases that a user could use 32-bit
Allegro CL with Unbuntu 14.04 (and later). As a consequence, we
announced that that OS was no longer supported for 32-bit
Lisps. (64-bit Allegro CL was not affected.)
</p>
<p id="79">
Then an Allegro CL user pointed out that there was in fact a way to
get 32-bit Allegro CL to work. Here are the steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="80">
Install Allegro CL as described in the Installation Guide. Try to
start the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) up by invoking the
<b>allegro</b> executable. If this works, you are done as you have the
necessary libraries. If this fails, go to step 2.
</li>
<li id="81">
Execute the following commands (you need sudo permissions to execute
them -- ask your system administrator if necessary):
<pre id="82">
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libc6:i386
  sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386
</pre>
<p id="83">
Once these commands complete, 32-bit Allegro CL should
work. Contact <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a>
if you have any problems.

</ol>




<hr><h2 id="84"><a name="selinux-2">4.2 Allegro CL may have problems starting up when run on SELinux</a></h2>

<p id="85">
Security-Enhanced Linux, or SELinux is a feature that is available on
many modern versions of Linux and is enabled by default on some. It
affects the way shared libraries are loaded and that can prevent
Allegro CL from starting up. The error you will likely see is
something like:
</p>

<pre id="86">
cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied
</pre>

<p id="87">
Or the error can be <b>segmentation fault</b>. The solution is to mark
the shared object files for special handling or to disable
SELinux. See

Instructions for Enterprise, Professional, and Student versions
</h4>
<ol>
<li id="105">
<b>Exit all running programs</b>. Installation is most likely to be
trouble free if there are no other programs running.
</li>

<li id="106">
<b>Display the Windows Explorer</b>. Find the
acl100.exe file you downloaded. 
(Express
users: the file is
acl100-express.exe).
</li>
<li id="107">
<b>Double click on acl100.exe</b> to
execute it. This starts an installation program. During the
installation, dialogs appear asking for input, as described in the
next steps. (If you are installing the Express Edition, the filename is
<i>acl82-express.exe</i>.)
</li>
<li id="108">
<b>First dialog</b>: this is an informational dialog telling you again
to exit all other running programs and informing you about licenses
and copyrights. Click on the Cancel button if you wish to stop the
installation (perhaps to exit running programs). Click Next to
continue.
</li>
<li id="109">
<b>Second dialog</b>: this dialog asks you for the location of the
Allegro directory. A default is provided: <b>c:/acl100/</b>
(<b>c:/acl100-express/</b> for the Express Edition) on main
drive (often C: but can be another drive). If you wish a location
other than the default, click on the Browse button and select a
directory. If you select an existing directory (not recommended), a
warning dialog is displayed saying the directory exists and asking if
you want to continue.  Once you have selected the desired location for
the Allegro directory, click the Next button. You can cancel by
clicking the Cancel button.
</li>
<li id="110">
<b>Third dialog</b>: this dialog asks if you wish to leave out
portions of the distribution: the [Allegro CL] documentation (about 26
Mbytes), the ANSI spec documentation (about 11 Mbytes), and
contributed files (about 3300 Kbytes). By default, the first two are
included and the third left out. 
<p id="111">
If you do not install either the Allegro CL documentation and the ANSI
spec, shortcuts relating to documentation on the Allegro CL menu item
on the Start menu will link you to versions on the Franz Inc. web
site. (However, if you have the space, it is best to include the
documentation.) If you include the Allegro CL documentation but not
the ANSI spec, links from the Allegro CL documentation to the ANSI
spec will not work.
</p>
<p id="112">
Check or uncheck the desired options. Click Cancel to cancel
installation, Back to choose a different location, and Next to
continue. If you click Next again, the installation will take place.
</p>
</li>
<li id="113">
<b>A dialog may appear when the installation is finished</b> telling
you you must restart the machine to complete the installation and
asking if you want to do this now. (Restarting is not always
necessary. Clicking Cancel ends the installation process for now and
does not restart the machine. If restarting is required and you choose
to delay it, do not use Allegro CL until you have restarted.  We
assume in the subsequent steps you have restarted if necessary.)

</p>

<hr><h2 id="124"><a name="windows-testing-2">5.1 Testing that the installation of Allegro CL on Windows was successful</a></h2>

<p id="125">
We will test the installation by starting Allegro CL from the menu.
You should see an `Allegro CL
10.0' item on the Programs submenu of the Start menu.
(`Allegro CL 10.0 Free Express Edition' for the Express Edition
and `Allegro CL 10.0 Student Edition' for Student.) That item
has a submenu, with (among other items) submenus <b>Modern ACL
Images</b> and <b>ANSI ACL Images</b>. We will start a Modern ACL with
the IDE in this example. The Express does not have submenus for
images, since only one is supplied (there are submenus for other
things).
</p>
<p id="126">
Choose 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="127">
<b>Start | Programs | Allegro CL
10.0 | Modern ACL Images | Allegro CL

a splash window and then a window titled `Allegro Common Lisp
Console'. Shortly thereafter, the Allegro CL
Integrated Development Environment windows appear, typically starting
with some dialogs which you must resond to or dismiss (dismissing is
okay). After everything is started, your screen will have various
windows, including the Debug (i.e. Listener) window shown here:
</p>
<p id="129"><img src="pictures/debug.jpg"></p>

<p id="130">
One of the dialogs that may appear, if you have worked on projects in
the IDE in earlier sessions, is the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a>
dialog, which asks if you want to open one of these recent
projects. (We do not show it because we are assuming you have just
installed Allegro CL. Note the Express edition does not have a startup
dialog.)

<hr><hr><h2 id="134"><a name="macosx-install-1">6.0 Installation on macOS</a></h2>

<p id="135">
<b>If you have installed or are about to install macOS version
10.10, them you must update Allegro CL 10.0 as described in this
section <a href="#mac-osx-yose-2">Section 6.2 Updating for macOS 10.10</a> below.</b> Users
newly installing Allegro CL 10.0 should also be sure to update after
installation. Also XQuartz needs to be updated after the macOS
10.10 upgrade. A link for that is provided
in <a href="#mac-osx-yose-2">Section 6.2 Updating for macOS 10.10</a> below.
</p>


<a name="back-from-xcode"></a>

<p id="136">
Allegro CL on macOS is distributed both as a
<b>.dmg</b> file and as a <b>.bz2</b> file (there is no bz2 file
available for the Allegro CL Express edition). You may install using
the <b>.dmg</b> as described in this section, or using
the <b>.bz2</b>, as described in
<a href="#install-steps-1">Section 3.0 Installation steps</a>. If you are using the
IDE, you must install GTK. This is done automatically by the Allegro CL app when you run it. If you are using CLIM, you must also install
Open Motif, as described
in <a href="#macosx-x11-2">Section 6.1 Installing GTK and Open Motif on macOS</a>. The rest of this
section assumes you are installing with the <b>.dmg</b> file.
</p>
<p id="137">
<b>A note about the Mountain Lion (10.8) version of macOS</b>: X11
is not installed as part of the Mountain Lion OS, and upgrading to
Mountain Lion will (apparently) uninstall X11. You can
install/reinstall X11 by downloading and
installing <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>. (Look
in the <b>Utilities</b> sub-folder of the <b>Applications</b> folder
to see if X11 is installed.)
</p>
<p id="138">
The .dmg installation has been simplified in release 10.0. 
</p>

<p id="139">
There are various <b>.dmg</b> files for Allegro CL 10.0, depending on what 
product you are installing (64 bit with SMP but no IDE, 64-bit without SMP but with IDE, or 32-bit with IDE). The file names are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="140">
acl100-macosx-x64.dmg
</li>
<li id="141">
acl100-smp-macosx-x64.dmg
</li>
<li id="142">
acl100-macosx-x86.dmg
</li>
</ul>
<p id="143">
Allegro CL requires macOS 10.6 or later.
</p>
<p id="144">
This is how to install Allegro CL on the Mac:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="145">
<b>Download the file to the local hard disk.</b>
</li>
<li id="146">
<b>Find the .dmg file in the Finder and double-click on it.</b>  This
will will open the <b>.dmg</b> file and and display a window similar
to the illustration, which is from the 64-bit non-SMP version -- for
other choices, there will be obvious changes (such as 32 instead of 64, SMP
appearing, etc.)

<p id="147"><img src="pictures/mac-install1.jpg"></p>

</li>
<li id="148">
<b>Drag the AllegroCL icon</b> to the Applications directory. (The
picture shows AllegroCL64 in the picture but your name may be
different depending on what you are installing).
<b>Authenticate as Administrator</b>. You may be asked to authenticate
the installation as Administrator at this point. Please do so.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="149">
Allegro CL will then be installed (a progress bar will be displayed
during installation). Once it is done, double click
on <b>Applications</b> and you should see an entry for Allegro CL.
</p>

<h3 id="150">
Installing the License File
</h3>

<p id="151">
Again, try to start Allegro CL with the IDE. If you need to install
the license file, you will get a message like that is the picture (if
you do not need a license file or one is already present, Allegro CL
will just start up). This will not work when starting mlisp or alisp.
</p>

<p id="152"><img src="pictures/mac-install2.jpg"></p>
<p id="153">
Make sure that you have a valid license file (the license file is supplied
separately, as described in
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>). It need not be
named <b>devel.lic</b> (the name will be changed when it is copied).
</p>
<p id="154">
<b>Click on the Install devel.lic button</b>. You will see a Finder
Window. Navigate to your devel.lic file and double click on it. It
will be copied to the correct location in the Allegro CL application.
</p>
<p id="155">
If the GTK Frame is not needed or already installed, Allegro CL will
start up. If not, you will see a message that the GTK Framework is not
installed, as shown in the illustration.
</p>
<p id="156"><img src="pictures/mac-install3.jpg"></p>

<p id="157">
Simple click on the Install GTK button. You may again be asked to
authenticate by providing the administrator password. The GTK
Framework will then be installed. (This takes a few seconds, but no
progress bar is displayed).
</p>
<p id="158">
That message will also appear if the GTK Framework is out of date or
does not work. If your have upgraded to macOS 10.10, the existing
version of the GTK Framework will fail. When you update Allegro CL
with <b>update.sh</b>, a new version of the GTK Framework will be
download and will install on first use by the IDE.
</p>
<p id="159">
Allegro CL should start up when the GTK Framework installation is complete.
</p>




<h3 id="160">
Download patches
</h3>
<p id="161">
You should download available patches. See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>. 
</p>


<hr><h2 id="162"><a name="macosx-x11-2">6.1 Installing GTK and Open Motif on macOS</a></h2>


<p id="163">
The .dmg installation described above takes care of installing GTK. If
you are using CLIM, you need to install Open Motif. If you installed
using the .bz2 file and wish to use the IDE, you need to install GTK
as described in this section.
</p>
<p id="164">
The IDE/Common Graphics require GTK, and CLIM additionally requires
the OpenMotif libraries.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="165"><a name="macosx-install-gtk-3">6.1.1 Installing X11 and GTK on macOS</a></h2>

<p id="166">
For version of macOS up to but not including Mountain Lion (10.8),
X11 should already be installed (if not, install it from your
installation medium). For Mountain Lion (10.8), it is not installed
and upgrading to Mountain Lion will (apparently) uninstall X11. You
can install/reinstall X11 by downloading and
installing <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>. (Look
in the <b>Utilities</b> sub-folder of the <b>Applications</b> folder
to see if X11 is installed.) <b>If you install Mavericks (macOS
10.9) after installing X11/XQuartz, you must
reinstall <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a></b>
(the XQuartz links are both to
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/).
</p>

<p id="167">
There are two steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="168">
<b>Download</b>
<a href="http://franz.com/ftp/pub/macosx/GTK+-Framework-2.22.dmg">http://franz.com/ftp/pub/macosx/GTK+-Framework-2.22.dmg</a> and
open it. In the Finder window that pops up, drag
the <b>Gtk.framework</b> file onto <b>Frameworks</b> (an alias for
/Library/Frameworks) On the right. This will install the Gtk
framework in the right place on your system.
<p id="169">
If you should get an error message about insufficient permissions,
it is likely you have an older version of the framework installed. To
get rid of the old version, type this into a terminal window:
</p>
<pre id="170">
 sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/{Gtk,Cairo,GLib}.framework
</pre>

<p id="171">
and retry this step.
</p>
</li>
<li id="172">
<b>Install patches and rebuild images</b>: the IDE needs updates
installed and images updated before it will work with the newly
installed GTK. You cannot do this with the IDE image (<b>allegro</b>)
since it will not start. Instead, start one of the non-IDE images
(such as <b>mlisp</b> or <b>alisp</b>),
evaluate <code>(sys:update-allegro)</code>, exit Lisp, and run
<b>update.sh</b>. Once images are updated, the <b>allegro</b>
executable will work.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="173">
After the <b>Gtk.framework</b> file is installed in this directory,
the IDE and Common Graphics (see <a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>) will be
ready to use.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="174"><a name="macosx-x11-maverick-3">6.1.2 X11/XQuartz and macOS 10.9 (Mavericks)</a></h2>

<p id="175">
To repeat what is said above, it appears installing macOS 10.9
(Mavericks) on a machine with XQuartz (X11) installed breaks the
XQuartz installation. After installation of Mavericks, you must
reinstall the latest XQuartz version
from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a>. This
is true even if you have installed the latest XQuartz version prior to
installing Mavericks.

<p id="176">
The symptom of a broken XQuartz is blank rectangles that should be filled
with text in Common Graphics and Gruff displays.

<hr><h2 id="189"><a name="mac-osx-yose-2">6.2 Updating for macOS 10.10</a></h2>


<p id="190">
The GTK Framework version supplied with Allegro CL 10.0 does not work
with macOS 10.10. A new version is available. If Allegro CL 10.0 is
already installed or you are just installing it, you should
run <b>update.sh</b> is all of the following locations before
upgrading to macOS 10.10. Then you must reinstall XQuartz after
upgrading to macOS 10.10.
</p>
<p id="191">
You should run <b>update.sh</b> in all of the following Allegro CL
locations installed on your machine (you may have one, two, or all
three installed -- the locations are Allegro CL 32-bit, Allegro CL
64-bit (non SMP), and Allegro CL 64-bit SMP):
</p>
<pre id="192">
      /Applications/AllegroCL32.app/Contents/Resources/
      /Applications/AllegroCL64.app/Contents/Resources/
      /Applications/AllegroCL64SMP/
</pre>
<p id="193">
Once <b>update.sh</b> has completed in each location and you have
updated to macOS 10.10 (you can update Allegro CL 10.0 before or
after installing macOS 10.10), you will have to reinstall XQuartz
(installing 10.10 apparently breaks the currently installed
XQuartz). Download
from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg</a>.
</p>
<p id="194">
Now that Allegro CL 10.0 is updated and the new XQuartz is installed,
Allegro CL should work without problem. When you start the IDE, you
will be prompted to update the GTK Framework to the new working
version.
</p>
<p id="195">
<b>Notes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li id="196">
While it is best to run <b>update.sh</b> while an earlier version of
macOS (such as 10.8 or 10.9) is installed, before you upgrade to
10.10, you can run it after upgrading. Note the IDE will not work
until after you have run <b>update.sh</b>. Again, after upgrading the
OS, you must reinstall XQuartz (installing 10.10 apparently breaks the
currently installed XQuartz). Download
from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg</a>.
</li>
<li id="197">
The IDE is not supported on Allegro CL 10.0 SMP. If you only have that
version installed, the GTK Framework is not necessary to run Allegro
CL (and updating, while generally a good idea, is not actually
required). However, if you happen to have the old GTK Framework
installed, which you use for other pruposes and would like the new
version, see <a href="#new-gtk-1010-3">Section 6.2.1 Getting a working GTK Framework on macOS 10.10 when you do not use the IDE</a> just below.

<p id="199">
Because Allegro CL 10.0 SMP does not support the IDE, it is not
necessary to have a working GTK Framework installed to use Allegro CL
10.0 SMP. If that is the only version you use, then no action is
required to run on macOS 10.10. However, if you happen to need the
GTK Framework for other uses and have been depending on the version
supplied with Allegro CL, you can get the updated version which works
with macOS 10.10 with the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="200">
Remove the previous version of the Gtk Framework:
<pre id="201">
   $ sudo rm -fr /Library/Frameworks/Gtk.framework
</pre>
</li>
<li id="202">

<p id="225">
We no longer supply a version of Emacs on the CD. In past releases,
the version on the CD quickly became out of date. Emacs is easily
downloaded from multiple sources on the net. See <a href="http://franz.com/emacs/">franz.com/emacs/</a> for
information.
</p>
<p id="226">
There is a downloadable installer for <b>GNU Emacs on Windows</b> on
<a href="http://franz.com/emacs/">franz.com/emacs/</a>. That
same location has links to locations from which to download Emacs for
Unix platforms.
</p>
<p id="227">
Once you have Emacs installed on your machine, you need to have it
load the Emacs-Lisp interface files when it starts up. You do this by
putting the appropriate form in your .emacs file, as described:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="228">
<b>On Windows</b>, create a .emacs file or add the following to your
existing .emacs file. (If you have a home directory on your Windows
machine -- many people do not -- place the .emacs file
there. Otherwise place the .emacs file in <b>c:\</b>.
<pre id="229">
(load "c:/acl100/eli/fi-site-init")
</pre>
<p id="230">
That form assumes you installed Allegro CL in the standard location,
 (load "c:/acl100/eli/fi-site-init")
Replace that with the correct location if it
is different.
</p>
</li>
<li id="231">
<b>On Unix/Linux/macOS</b>, create a .emacs file or add the
following to your existing .emacs file. The .emacs file goes in your
home directory.
<pre id="232">
(load "/usr/local/acl100/eli/fi-site-init")
</pre>
<p id="233">
That form assumes you installed Allegro CL in the standard location,
<b>/usr/local/acl100/</b>. Replace

</li>
</ul>

<p id="234">
The page at <a href="http://franz.com/emacs/">franz.com/emacs/</a> has

<b>Note: the contents of this section were updated in January, 2016
and again in May, 2016. The updates affect versions 8.2, 9.0, and
10.0.</b>
</p>



<p id="237">
For customers with an Enterprise license (or above), Allegro CL
supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, as described in
<a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>. The OpenSSL
libraries are necessary to make use of this facility. Prior
to a patch release in May, 2016, the Allegro CL distribution
included the OpenSSL libraries for all platforms except Windows. Now,
no OpenSSL libraries are included with teh Allegro CL
distribution. (This allows users usually to have the latest OpenSSL
version without an update to Allegro CL.)
</p>

<h3 id="238">
Installing OpenSSL libraries on Unix platforms
</h3>
<p id="239">
Many linux platforms and the Mac include OpenSSL as part of the
regular OS installation. On such platforms, no action is typically
required to use OpenSSL with Allegro CL. If your platform does not
include OpenSSL libraries or if for some reason you want a different
version than that supplied by the OS, get further information
at <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">openssl.org</a>. See <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</a>
in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a> for further information and
instructions on how to ensure Allegro CL can find the OpenSSL
libraries when required.

Installing OpenSSL libraries on Windows
</h3>
<ol>
<li id="241">
<b>Update Allegro CL</b>: see <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> for information on
updating. (You can use that function or use other tools described
on <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>'s
documentation page. You may have already updated as part of general
installation.)

<li id="242">
Follow the instructions

<hr><hr><h2 id="244"><a name="other-products-1">9.0 Other Allegro CL products</a></h2>

<p id="245">
Allegro CL comes with various add-on products, such as the CLIM
windowing system and Orblink. Some require additional licenses. Others
are available to all users. All material needed for these products is
in the distribution. Only the license file determines
whether products can be used or not. Contact your Franz Inc. Account
Manager for information on licensing.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="246"><a name="license-file-1">10.0 Getting a license file</a></h2>

<p id="247">
You must have a license file to use Allegro CL and its associated
products. The license file is not included with the distribution.
</p>
<p id="248">
Professional and Enterprise customers with current maintenance
agreements should have received an email message from Franz Inc. with
instructions on how to obtain their license file. Express Edition
customers should receive such an email after providing the necessary
information to Franz Inc. (usually by filling in a form on the Franz
Inc. web site, franz.com).
</p>
<p id="249">
The email sent by Franz Inc. gives an URL from which the license file
can be retrieved. The email is in Mime format, with plain text and
HTML versions. If you are able to read mail in a mime-enabled client,
you will be able to click on the URL immediately.
</p>
<p id="250">
You should retrieve the license as soon as you receive the email even
if you have not downloaded the software. Then the license file will be
ready when you install Allegro CL. The name of the file when it is put
in the Allegro directory must be
<i>devel.lic</i>. However, you may use any name when
retrieving, renaming when you copy it to the Allegro directory later.
</p>
<p id="251">
The license file is a text file which includes encrypted text. See
<a href="startup.htm#license-file-1">The Allegro CL
license file</a> in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for a sample
(with the encrypted text much and obviously modified).
</p>
<p id="252">
If you upgrade your license or purchase add-on products, you will be
sent email with instructions for retrieving a new license
file. Placing the new license file in the Allegro directory is all you
must do to use the upgraded version of the new add-on products.
</p>

<p id="253">
If you do not have a license file or the license file you have does
not seem to license the correct product mix, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for information. (That link goes to the file
<a href="introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>. If that link does not work, call

<p id="255">
In order to get source code (if your license allows it), you must
return the source code license addendum included with the
distribution. When that addendum is received, you will be sent a new
license which allows installing source code. (Some sources are free to
licensed customers and others are provided for an additional
charge. If you have questions about getting source code, please
<a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your
Account Manager</a>.)
</p>
<p id="256">
The sources available are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="257">
<b>Lisp</b>: The Lisp sources to basic Common Lisp and CLOS, plus many
Allegro provided features (jLinker, regexp v2, etc) and Common
Graphics, the IDE, and DDE on Windows. No compiler or runtime system
is provided.

</li>
<li id="262">
<b>ORBLink</b>: the entire sources to ORBLink (all in Lisp).
</li>
</ul>



<p id="263">
To install sources, do the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="264">
<b>On Windows</b>, open the Windows Explorer.
</li>
<li id="265"><b>On Windows</b>, find the Allegro directory in the explorer (it
is typically <em>c:\Program Files\aclXX\</em> where XX is the release
number without the dot (like acl101) but you may have chosen a
different directory).
<br>

<strong>On UNIX</strong>, <strong>cd</strong> to the Allegro directory
(it is typically <em>/usr/local/acl[versionrelease-number]/</em>
but you may have chosen a different directory) in a shell.
</li>
<li id="266">
<b>On Windows</b>, double-click on the files <em>srclisp.bat</em> (and
also, if appropriate <i>srcclim.bat</i>,
<i>srcaodbc.bat</i>, <i>srcmysql.bat</i>,
<i>srcoracle.bat</i>,
and <i>srcorblink.bat</i>). Note that the CG and IDE
sources are unpacked by <i>srclisp.bat</i>.
<br>

<strong>On UNIX</strong>, run <i>./srclisp.sh</i> (and
also, if appropriate <i>./srcclim.sh</i>,
<i>./srcaodbc.sh</i>,
<i>./srcmysql.sh</i>,
<i>./srcoracle.sh</i>, and
<i>./srcorblink.sh</i>).
</li>
</ol>

<p id="267">
Assuming you have the new license with the source code module
included, the encrypted source files in the <em>src/</em> directory
should be unencrypted and expanded so the source code will be located
in subdirectories of the <em>src/</em> directory.

Information on Allegro CL Express
</h2>
<p id="286">
The Express Edition, available for Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, and macOS
(for Intel processors), is provided free of charge so that potential
users may gain experience using Allegro CL and some add-ons before
purchasing.  The Express Edition is fully described on the Franz
Inc. web site (<a href="http://franz.com">franz.com</a>, click on
the <b>Download</b> button to see information about Express
software). That information may be updated more frequently than the
information here. If there is a conflict between the information on
the Web site and the information given here, the information on the
Web site is correct.
</p>
<p id="287">
CLIM and Allegro Composer are not available with Allegro CL Express.
</p>
<p id="288">
To obtain an Express Edition, you fill out an information form on the
Franz Inc. web site. Then, on Windows, you download a self-installing
executable while on UNIX and UNIX-like platforms, you download a
compressed file which does the installation when uncompressed. On both
Windows and UNIX, the installation also obtains the license file
needed to run the software (you must be connected to the internet
during installation).
</p>
<p id="289">
The Express Edition must be
downloaded. The Windows version does not include the documentation
(but instead links to the documentation on the Web site).
</p>

<hr><h2 id="290"><a name="express-license-2">12.1 Information on the Express license</a></h2>

<p id="291">
Because there were many problems with downloading license files (many
associated with firewalls, proxies, and the like), we have a new
license scheme: you get a license with the download and that license
is good for about a year. When it expires, there will either be a new
version of Express of a way to get a new license.
</p>







<hr><h2 id="292"><a name="express-linux-ide-2">12.2 Running the IDE in Allegro CL 10.0 Express on Linux</a></h2>

<p id="293">
To use the IDE on Linux, just as on Windows, you invoke the allegro or
allegro-express executable. The associated image includes the IDE and
starts it when Allegro CL is started. You do this also with Allegro CL
Express on Linux on x86 processors.
</p>
<p id="294">
But in Allegro CL Professional and Enterprise, you can also start a
non-IDE image (alisp or mlisp) and load the IDE and call <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>ide:start-ide</b></a> (as described in
<a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>). This second method does not work in
Allegro CL Express Edition. To use the IDE, you must use the
<b>allegro-express</b> executable/image.
</p>
<p id="295">
Thus, you start Allegro CL in Emacs with the Emacs function
<b>fi:common-lisp</b> (see <a href="startup.htm#acl-as-emacs-subprocess-1">Running Lisp as a subprocess of
Emacs</a> in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a>). When you are asked
for the <b>Executable Image Name</b>, specify <b>allegro</b> (for a
case-sensitive, modern image) or <b>allegro-ansi</b> (for a
case-insensitive ANSI image). The IDE will start when Allegro CL
does. 
</p>



<hr><h2 id="296"><a name="express-images-2">12.3 Creating additional Express Edition images on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="297">
To make the downloadable file as small as possible, on Windows we have
only included one Allegro CL image, <b>allegro-express.exe</b>, one that
includes the IDE and is in International "ANSI" mode (case insensitive
upper, as opposed to case sensitive lower of "Modern" images).
</p>
<p id="298">
The other images which are commonly found in an Allegro CL
installation are:
