<p id="5">
Allegro CL provides a number of facilities for debugging and
correcting Lisp code.  Among these facilities are a set of commands to
view and manipulate the runtime stack, a tracer, a stepper and an
inspector. All are documented in this document except the inspector,
which is documented in <a href="inspector.htm">inspector.htm</a>. 
</p>

<p id="6">
Debugger functionality is included by default in development images
(those built with either the <em>include-debugger</em> or
<em>include-devel-env</em> arguments to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> specified true). If you are
building a runtime image and want debugging capability, be sure to
specify <em>include-debugger</em> true (you cannot specify
<em>include-devel-env</em> true when building a runtime image).  See
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> and
<a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a> for information on
arguments to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. Note that the stepper is not
permitted in runtime images.
</p>

<p id="7">
A feature in Allegro CL is the ability to debug background
processes in separate Lisp listeners. See <a href="operators/excl/use-background-streams.htm"><b>use-background-streams</b></a> and 
<a href="#background-processes-1">Section 4.0 Debugging background processes</a>
for more information. If you are unable to use the facility described
there, note the following. When multiprocessing is enabled, the user
must be careful to ensure that he or she is debugging the correct
process. The user types to the <i>listener</i> process, and debugs the
<i>focused</i> process. Initially, they are the same process. The
focus is changed only by user action. But if the focus is changed, the
processes will not be the same, and it is important that the user keep
track of which process is being debugged.  Where relevant, the
description of a debugging command specifies how it is used with
multiprocessing. Users who are not using the multiprocessing facility
need not concern themselves with these distinctions. 
</p>

<p id="8">
Note too that debugging compiled code is affected by what
optimizations were in force when the code was compiled. These
optimizations are discussed in <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>.
Suffice it to say here that functions compiled for speed over safety
may be harder to debug for the following reasons. 
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="9">Functions may be compiled inline, so it may be hard to figure out where you are,
    comparing what you expect from looking at the source to what you see on the stack. </li>
  <li id="10">The real error may have gone unnoticed and the reported error may occur much later,
    perhaps in a different function. Thus you may notice unexpected arguments to a function
    (resulting in an error) but it may be difficult to discover where these arguments came
    from. </li>
  <li id="11">The error messages themselves may be quite uninformative. This is because errors are not
    caught by type or argument checking, but rather later, system problems.</li>
</ol>

<p id="12">One more point: if an error occurs in code compiled for speed over
safety which is hard to debug, one strategy is to recompile the code
for safety over speed. It should then be easier to correct.</p>

<h3 id="13">
The debugger in an application
</h3>

<p id="14">
You can include much of the debugger (except the stepper) in a runtime
application (see <a href="runtime.htm">runtime.htm</a> for details). Further,
the document <a href="debugger-api.htm">debugger-api.htm</a> provides information
about the internals of the debugger and using it, it is possible to
provide a customized debugging interface. Note that
<a href="debugger-api.htm">debugger-api.htm</a> does not describe things needed in
ordinary use of Allegro CL.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="15"><a name="debugger-getting-out-1">2.0 Getting out of the debugger</a></h2>

<p id="16">Debugger commands are available all the time, so you are never
really in or out of the debugger. When an error occurs, you are put
into a break loop (as indicated by the number in brackets in the
prompt). See <a href="top-level.htm">top-level.htm</a> for complete
details, but briefly, the top-level command <a href="tpl-commands/pop.htm"><b>:pop</b></a> will pop up one break level and the
top-level command <a href="tpl-commands/reset.htm"><b>:reset</b></a> will
return you to the top-level, out of all break levels, as the following
example shows:</p>

<pre id="17">
USER(1): (car 1)
Error: Attempt to take the car of 1 which is not listp.
   [condition type: SIMPLE-ERROR]
[1] USER(2): :reset
USER(3):
</pre>

<hr><hr><h2 id="18"><a name="internal-funs-1">3.0 Internal functions</a></h2>

<p id="19">Users trying to debug code will often have occasion to look at the
stack for a list of recent function calls. Included in the list will
be functions with names like: <strong><em>operator</em>_2op</strong>
and <strong><em>operator</em>_3op</strong> where
<em><strong>operator</strong></em> is a numeric function such as *, +,
&lt;, etc. These functions are used in place of the expected functions
(*, +, &lt;, etc.) for compiler efficiency. They should be interpreted
as the functions named by operator. Thus, for example,
<strong>&lt;_2op</strong> should be interpreted <strong>&lt;</strong>
(i.e. the less-than predicate). </p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="20"><a name="background-processes-1">4.0 Debugging background processes</a></h2>

<p id="21">The background-streams facilities described in this section only
work when Allegro CL has been started with the
<strong>fi:common-lisp</strong> command to Emacs. The Emacs-Lisp
interface is fully described in 
<a href="eli.htm">eli.htm</a>. If you are not running under Emacs
(or if the backdoor connection between Lisp and Emacs has not been
established), you will not get the behavior described here. Note that
it is not an error to use background streams when not running Lisp
under Emacs. The described effect (creating a new listener in another
Emacs buffer) will not happen. But if you later establish the
connection, background streams will be used. The function <a href="operators/excl/use-background-streams.htm"><b>use-background-streams</b></a> is called
automatically when Lisp starts up so it is not necessary to call it
explicitly.  However, you should call it if you do not get the
expected behavior.</p>

<p id="22">If an error occurs in a background process while Allegro Composer
is not running, another listener buffer is created at once and output
from the error is printed in the new listener buffer. To test the
effect of background streams, evaluate the following forms.</p>

<pre id="23">
(fmakunbound 'foo)
  (mp:process-run-function "bad process" 'foo)
</pre>

<p id="24">These forms start a background process that will break and cause a
new listener to be created. A message will be printed to the new
listener saying that a background process has broken due to foo being
undefined.</p>

<p id="25">Background streams work by setting the global values of the
following streams to the background stream:</p>

<pre id="26">
*terminal-io*
*debug-io*
*standard-input*
*query-io*
</pre>


<p id="27">Note that setting the value of those streams has the following
consequences: </p>

<ul>
  <li id="28">The debugger checks to see if <code>*debug-io*</code> is a
    background stream and if so,
    it causes a listener to be created.</li>
  <li id="29">Any attempt to do I/O on those streams results in an error.</li>
</ul>

<p id="30">The second effect is less drastic than it sounds. The existing Lisp
listener (what you see when Lisp starts up) has already bound all the
listed streams so it does not see the global value at all. There may
be a problem if you start your own processes (with, e.g., <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a>),
however.  You should (and all applications should) set up your own
streams. Consider the following two examples. In the first, the
function run by <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a> takes a stream
argument and is passed <code>*terminal-io*</code>. This will work
without error. In the second, the function itself contains a reference
to <code>*terminal-io*</code>. It will signal an error if background
streams are used.</p>

<pre id="31">
;;; This will work:
(mp:process-run-function
      "foo"
      #'(lambda (stream)
          (format stream "This is from process ~a~%"
                  mp:*current-process*))
      *terminal-io*)
;;; This will fail:
(mp:process-run-function
      "foo"
      #'(lambda ()
          (format *terminal-io* "This is from process ~a~%"
          mp:*current-process*)))
</pre>

<p id="32">The variable <a href="variables/excl/s_initial-terminal-io_s.htm"><code>*initial-terminal-io*</code></a> holds the original
<code>*terminal-io*</code> stream when Lisp starts up. It may be
useful for processes that aren't connected to a usable
<code>*terminal-io*</code> but wish to produce some output, for
example for debugging. </p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="33"><a name="stack-commands-1">5.0 Stack commands </a></h2>

<p id="34">The <i>runtime stack</i> is the entity where arguments and
variables local to Lisp functions are stored. When a function is
called, the calling function evaluates and <i>pushes</i> the arguments
to the called function onto the stack. The called function then
references the stack when accessing its arguments. It also allocates
space for its local variables. A <i>stack frame</i> is the area on the
stack where the arguments to one function call and also its local
variables reside. If <b>foo</b> calls <b>bar</b>, which in turns calls
<b>yaf</b>, then (at least, and typically) three stack frames are
<i>active</i> when <b>yaf</b> is entered. The frame for the most
recently called function is on the <i>top</i> of the stack. The
commands described in the following subsections access and display the
stack.  After a frame is examined, it normally becomes the <i>current
stack frame</i>. Further reference to the stack will, by default,
operate on the current stack frame. When a break level is entered, the
current frame pointer is typically the first interesting frame.</p>

<p id="35">A <em>frame object</em> is a type of Lisp object. A <em>frame
expression</em> is the printed representation of that object. We are
somewhat imprecise in this document in distinguishing between frame
objects (the internal Lisp object) and frame expressions (what you see
printed) because in most cases, the distinction is not
important. Where the distinction is important, we say <em>frame
object</em> or <em>frame expression</em>.</p>

<hr><h2 id="36"><a name="zoom-2">5.1 :zoom</a></h2>

<p id="37">The <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> top-level command
prints the evaluation stack. It uses the current stack frame as the
center of attention, and prints some number of frames on either side
of the current frame. The value of the variable <a href="variables/tpl/s_zoom-display_s.htm"><code>*zoom-display*</code></a> is the
total number of frames to display, and an equal number of frames are
printed above and below the current stack frame, if possible. The
arguments to the <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> command
control the type and quantity of the displayed stack. </p>

<p id="38">
After a <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> or any of its
analogs (such as <a href="tpl-commands/top.htm"><b>:top</b></a> or <a href="tpl-commands/bottom.htm"><b>:bottom</b></a>) the special variable
<code>cl:*</code> contains the lisp expression representing the
current frame. That expression is approximately what is shown in a
moderate display with <code>:function</code> 
&nbsp;<code>nil</code>, regardless of the mode in which <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> itself displays.
</p>

<p id="39">
Here are some examples of <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a>

<code>foo</code>, which has no value.</p>

function suspended at relative address 600
</pre>

<p id="51">The suspension location may be relative or absolute (it is relative
in the example just shown). It represents the value of the program
counter at the time the function was suspended (usually because it
called another function). The suspension location may be the
instruction that caused the suspension (a call instruction or an
instruction that caused trapping) or it may be the next instruction to
be executed when the function is reactivated. </p>

<p id="52">Suspension locations are interpreted as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li id="53"><strong>Relative</strong>: a relative address is the distance from the start of the
    function's codevector. It can be seen by disassembling the function with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/disassem.htm"><b>disassemble</b></a>
    with the absolute keyword argument <code>nil</code> (see <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>
    for information on <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/disassem.htm"><b>disassemble</b></a>). The leftmost column of the
    disassembly shows the relative address of each instruction in bytes. Relative addresses
    are needed for Lisp functions because their codevectors may move so the actual address of
    a particular function may change after a garbage collection. </li>
  <li id="54"><strong>Absolute</strong>: an absolute address is an address that will not change within
    the current Lisp process execution. Absolute addresses will be given when a frame
    represents a runtime operation. Examples of runtime operations are calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/apply.htm"><b>apply</b></a>
    and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a> , which are written in low-level lisp-assembler code.</li>
</ul>

<p id="55">When a runtime operation is encountered in
<code>:verbose</code> mode, a symbol-table is built (if an
up-to-date one does not already exist) if possible. This build may
take some time and trigger several garbage collections. After the
symbol table is built, the address is associated with a name in the table
and printed as its offset. </p>

<p id="56">If the symbol table cannot be built, then no interpretation is
given to the suspension location, only the absolute address is
shown. Here is an example from the verbose backtrace following the
attempt to evaluate an unbound variable:</p>

<pre id="57">
----------------------------
 -&gt;call to SYS::..CONTEXT-SAVING-RUNTIME-OPERATION with 0 arguments.
function suspended at address #x6fa1b1d0 (unbound+404)
</pre>

<p id="58">Note that any non-lisp function can be disassembled (with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/disassem.htm"><b>disassemble</b></a>) if it is represented in
the symbol table by the string associated with its name. Thus</p>

<pre id="59">
(cl:disassemble "qcons")
</pre>

<p id="60">will print the disassembly of the runtime operation
"qcons". If the name is not in the symbol table,
cl:disassemble will complain that the argument is invalid.</p>

<p id="132">Allegro CL provides for examining and modifying the values of local
variables in compiled code but this facility comes at a fairly
significant space cost (since extra information is needed in compiled
code to provide the debugger with this information).  Therefore, the
enhancement is only available in code compiled with the debug
optimization quality set to 3 (assuming compiler switches have their
default values). Further, local name information (which is very useful
for debugging) is only loaded from a compiled file if the variable
<a href="variables/excl/s_load-local-names-info_s.htm"><code>*load-local-names-info*</code></a> is non-<code>nil</code> when the compiled (fasl) file is loaded.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="133"><a name="discarding-local-variable-info-2">6.1 Discard local variable information before dumplisp</a></h2>

<p id="134">Before we discuss local variables in detail, we should remark that
the information necessary to provide information on local variables
for debugging takes up a fairly significant amount of space in the
image. If you have completed debugging and you want to dump an image
(with <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>), you may
want to discard this information before dumping (to save space in the
dumped image). The function <a href="operators/excl/discard-local-name-info.htm"><b>discard-local-name-info</b></a> will do that.</p>



<hr><h2 id="135"><a name="local-discussion-summary-2">6.2 Summary of the discussion of locals </a></h2>

<ul>
  <li id="136">In code compiled with debug=3 (so <a href="variables/compiler/save-local-scopes-switch.htm"><code>save-local-scopes-switch</code></a>
    is true), information on the live ranges of local variables is stored. The debugger uses
    this information when the <a href="tpl-commands/local.htm"><b>:local</b></a> command
    is executed to print out just the locals which have valid values and are still in use.
    (The live range of a local is defined below. It is basically the time after a local is
    first assigned a value until the local is last used.) The variable 
    <a href="variables/excl/s_load-local-names-info_s.htm"><code>*load-local-names-info*</code></a> 
    should be non-<code>nil</code> when compiled (fasl) files
    created with local variable information are loaded.
  </li>
  <li id="137">There is a significant space cost to storing information on the live range of locals.
    For this reason, it is only done (by default) when debug=3. We do not recommend compiling
    code with debug=3 except for purposes of debugging.</li>
  <li id="138">In code compiled with debug=1 or debug=2, live ranges of locals are not stored. The
    debugger prints the contents of all locations assigned to locals when the <a href="tpl-commands/local.htm"><b>:local</b></a> command is executed. The value in a
    location of a local not yet assigned a value may cause the debugger to print a great deal
    of garbage.</li>
</ul>




<hr><h2 id="139"><a name="waht-are-locals-2">6.3 What are local variables?</a></h2>

<p id="140">The local variables in a function include the arguments of the
function and variables bound in a let or similar form within the
function. Arguments and other local variables are handled differently
by the system, as we describe below.</p>



<hr><h2 id="141"><a name="compiler-treatment-of-locals-2">6.4 How does the compiler treat local variables?</a></h2>

<p id="142">The names of local variables are not necessary in compiled code
(the locations are sufficient). Saving names takes space. The compiler
will only save names when the speed, safety, and debug compiler
optimization qualities are such that the compiler switch <a href="variables/compiler/save-local-names-switch.htm"><code>save-local-names-switch</code></a> is
true. It is usual when developing code (so debugging is likely) to
compile with that switch true, so names are available. In production
code, it is usual to compile so names are not saved, to save
space. When debugging code where names are not saved, locals are
identified by a numerical index.</p>

<p id="143">
Further, local name information, if stored in a compiled file, is only
loaded if the value of the variable <a href="variables/excl/s_load-local-names-info_s.htm"><code>*load-local-names-info*</code></a> is non-<code>nil</code> when compiled (fasl) files created with local
variable information are loaded.
</p>


<p id="144">Locals may be stored on the stack or in registers. Which method is
used depends on the type of processor. When there is hardware support
for using registers, the compiler stores local variables in
registers. The processors that provide that support include the Sparc
and the IBM RS/6000 processor. Where the necessary hardware support
does not exist, locals are stored on the stack. (Some locals may be
stored on the stack even in machines with the necessary hardware
support. This happens when the number of live locals at some point
exceeds the number of available registers -- eight on the Sparc and
ten on the RS/6000.) </p>



<hr><h2 id="145"><a name="using-registers-vs-using-stack-2">6.5 What is the difference between using registers and using the stack?</a></h2>

<p id="146">
The advantage of register access is that it is much faster than
stack access. But there is also a downside: there may not be a
variable name associated with the register, because it is transient
(because of efficient compilation) and never stored on the stack. This
means that debugging will be harder.
</p>

<p id="147">
We will get back to the advantages of placing values only in registers
below, but we want to emphasize the debugging costs so that they are
clear. Consider this example:
</p>
<pre id="148">
(defun blah (&rest format-args)
  (let ((result (apply #'format nil format-args)))
    (read-from-string result)))

(compile 'blah)

(blah "~a/0" 42)
</pre>

<p id="149">
Evaluating the last form will cause a divide by zero
(<code>result</code> is the string "42/0", which is then
read). But the variable named <code>result</code> never shows up
on the stack because it is transiently used as the return value from
an <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/apply.htm"><b>apply</b></a> and as the first
argument to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-fro.htm"><b>read-from-string</b></a>, and thus does not
even move from its register location - in all Allegro CL
implementations, the first return-value register is also the first
argument register; this provides for extremely efficient
code. Therefore, when debugging (after the divide by zero error is
signaled), you want to look at the value of <code>result</code>
but will not be able to see it under that name.
</p>

<p id="150">
If you want to force storing values on the stack, you can trace
<b>read-from-string</b> with a form like
</p>
<pre id="151">
(trace (read-from-string :inside blah))
</pre>
<p id="152">
Or you can use the <a href="tpl-commands/break.htm"><b>:break</b></a>
top-level command to set an instruction-level breakpoint and
setting :ldb mode on will allow single-stepping to track the variables
(including the arg0/result register) if the user knows how to look at
the disassembler output and interpret assembler code.
</p>
<p id="153">
Or you can redefine <code>blah</code> to force
<code>result</code> onto the stack so that it will show up as
a local variable:
</p>
<pre id="154">
(defun blarg () nil)

(defun blah (&rest format-args)
  (let ((result (apply #'format nil format-args)))
    (blarg)
    (read-from-string result)))
</pre>

<p id="155">
Inserting the call to <code>blarg</code> forces
<code>result</code> onto the stack (because the register holding
its value cannot be protected during a function
call). <code>result</code> will thus show up in debugger when
the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-fro.htm"><b>read-from-string</b></a>
errors. Note, however, that if local-scopes are compiled in, then the
debugger will not show the variable named <code>result</code>,
because it is a dead local (its last usage is as an argument to
read-from-string). To see the name in that situation,
<code>tpl::*print-dead-locals*</code> must be set to t (see 
<a href="#want-to-see-dead-locals-2">Section 6.15 I compiled with debug=3 but I want to see dead locals anyway</a>).
</p>

<p id="156">
Now back to the advantages of using registers to hold values. Because
of the very significant performance boost, registers are used whenever
possible. Further, when registers are used, the compiler will analyze
the code in order to determine the live ranges of locals and have
locals with disjoint live ranges share the same register (<em>live
range</em> is defined just <a href="#live-and-dead-ranges-2">below</a>). This allows
maximum use of registers.
</p>

<p id="157">
Locals stored on the stack do not share locations -- that is, each
local stored on the stack is assigned its own location. This is true
on machines where all locals are stored on the stack and on machines
where some locals are stored in registers and others are stored on the
stack. It may be that sharing locations on the stack would be a
desirable optimization (because of reduced stack growth). However, it
has not been implemented.</p>

<p id="158">The examples in the rest of this section are taken from a Sparc
machine and therefore registers are used for locals. All the behavior
described applies to any machine (whether or not registers are used to
store locals) except maybe the concept of register sharing.</p>



<hr><h2 id="159"><a name="live-and-dead-ranges-2">6.6 Live and dead ranges of local variables</a></h2>

<p id="160">When compiling a function, the compiler tries to determine when a
local variable is first used (typically, when it is bound) and when a
local variable is last used. The time that the local is used is called
the <em>live range</em> of the local. </p>

<p id="161">When locals can be stored in registers, if two locals have disjoint
live ranges, the compiler may use the same register to store the
values of both variables.</p>



<hr><h2 id="162"><a name="locals-in-tail-functions-2">6.7 Locals and functions in the tail position</a></h2>

<p id="163">Consider this definition:</p>

<pre id="164">
(defun foo (lis)
  (let ((a 10) (b 9))
    (pprint (list a b lis))
    (list-length lis)))
</pre>

<p id="165">The function <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> is
in the tail position, which means that what it returns will be
returned by <strong>foo</strong>, and so no information about
<strong>foo</strong> is needed on the stack. The compiler will always
arrange that the stack is cleared of all but the tail position
function when possible (regardless of whether it tail merges or
not). Therefore, the form <code>(foo 10)</code> will cause an
error when <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> is
applied to 10 -- which is not a list -- but the values of locals
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> will not be available.</p>



<hr><h2 id="166"><a name="live-range-example-2">6.8 Example showing live range</a></h2>

<p id="167">The live and dead ranges are best shown by example. Consider the
following function definition:</p>

<pre id="168">
(defun loc-fun (arg)
  (let ((a (+ arg 1)) ;; a alive but see text
        (b (+ arg 2)) ;; b alive but see text
        (c 3)) ;; c alive
    (break "break1")
    (setq c (+ a b c arg))
                     
;; a and b are now dead
    (let ((d 4) ;; d alive
          (e 5)) ;; e alive
      (break "break2")
      (print (* d e c))))
                     
;; c, d, and e are now dead
  (let* ((x 10) ;; x alive
         (y 11) ;; y alive
         (z 12)) ;; z alive
    (break "break3")
    (print (+ x y z))))
</pre>

<p id="169">The comments show where the various locals become alive and when
they die. There is an issue about where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>
become alive. Strictly speaking, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and
<em>c</em> all become alive when the binding form completes. That is
guaranteed in <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/letlet.htm"><b>let</b></a> so if
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> had lexically apparent values from above the
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/letlet.htm"><b>let</b></a> form, they could be used
later in the binding form. In fact that does not happen, so the
compiler may make the assignment at the position indicated rather than
later. This point is illustrated under the heading

<p id="176">Three registers are used. y and c share the first. x, d, and b

register are disjoint (that is what allows them to share the
register).  The important result of this is that at any particular
time, only the values of live locals are meaningful. On machines that
do not use registers to store locals, no sharing would take
place. Each local would have its own location on the stack.</p>

we can see that <em>a</em> is in 2 (the argument 22, plus 1) and
<em>b</em> is in 3 (arg plus 2). <em>c</em> might be in 1 or 4 (later,
we can determine it is in 1) but it is often hard to figure out what
is going on. Further, some of the registers contain garbage and the
printed representation may not possibly represent a Lisp object (5,
e.g.) or may be a Lisp object but simply left over from some earlier
call (the rest).</p>

<p id="181">In any case, it is not very useful for debugging but remember, that

<p id="194">As we will show, examining locals in code compiled at debug=3 (so
the compiler switch <a href="variables/compiler/save-local-scopes-switch.htm"><code>save-local-scopes-switch</code></a> is true) is
cleaner and easier than in code compiled so the switch is false. The
improvement is achieved by only printing the values of locals which
are alive at the time of examination (equivalently, by suppressing the
printing of dead locals). Why not have the clean behavior at all
settings?</p>

<p id="195">The reason is that there is a downside in suppressing dead locals:
a fairly significant increase in the size of compiled code. This
increase comes about because a lot of information about when locals
become alive and become dead is saved. </p>

<p id="196">The space hit is why the switch is only true (in the default) when

<hr><h2 id="206"><a name="locals-debug-three-speed-three-2">6.14 The behavior with debug=3 and speed=3</a></h2>

<p id="207">
Recall <a href="#live-range-example-2">above</a>
when we defined loc-fun, we pointed out that the live ranges of
variables bound in a let form may start sooner than expected:
</p>

<pre id="208">
(defun loc-fun (arg)
  (let ((a (+ arg 1)) ;; a alive but see text
        (b (+ arg 2)) ;; b alive but see text
        (c 3)) ;; c alive
  [...]
</pre>

<p id="209">As we said above, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> should not be live (as
locals) until the end of the binding form. The compiler can, however,
see that they are not used and so may actually make the assignments as
it processes each form in the binding form. The compiler will do this
when the compiler switch <a href="variables/compiler/internal-optimize-switch.htm"><code>internal-optimize-switch</code></a> is true. This
happens (by default) when debug is less than 3 or when debug is 3 and
speed is 3. To illustrate this, let us define a new function that
places breaks in the binding forms:</p>

<pre id="210">
(defun loc-fun-2 (arg)
  (let ((a (+ 2 (bar arg)))
        (b (+ 3 (baz arg))))
    (break "break3")
    (print (+ a b))))
(defun bar (x) (break "break1") x)
(defun baz (x) (break "break2") x)
</pre>

<p id="211"><strong>bar</strong> and <strong>baz</strong> just break and return
their argument, allowing us to break while the binding form is being
evaluated. The question is, when do <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> become
alive? If <strong>loc-fun-2</strong> is compiled with speed=3 debug=3,
<em>a</em> becomes alive before the <em>b</em> binding form completes
(that is, before break2 in <strong>baz</strong> is reached). If
<strong>loc-fun-2</strong> is compiled with speed=1 debug=3 (or
speed=2 debug=3), <em>a</em> becomes alive when the whole binding form
completes. This is illustrated by the transcripts below. Since the
transcripts are the same except for the locals printed, we simply have
one transcript with two columns when locals are shown. On the left,
<strong>loc-fun-2</strong> is compiled with speed=3 debug=3; on the
right, with speed=1 debug=3:</p>

<hr><h2 id="214"><a name="want-to-see-dead-locals-2">6.15 I compiled with debug=3 but I want to see dead locals anyway</a></h2>

<p id="215">This is possible but the interface is not optimal. There is an
internal (i.e. not exported) variable which we are about to define
that causes the debugger to print dead locals, either those that are
not yet alive and those that were alive but are now dead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="216">[Variable]</p>
  <p id="217"><code>tpl::*print-dead-locals*</code></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p id="218">When <code>nil</code> (the initial value), the
    debugger will suppress the printing of dead local variables. This
    suppression will only happen in functions compiled with the switch
    <a href="variables/compiler/save-local-scopes-switch.htm"><code>save-local-scopes-switch</code></a> true, in the
    default when and only when debug = 3.</p> <p id="219">When true, dead
    locals are printed, regardless of how the function was
    compiled.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p id="220">
As we said at the beginning, one problem with printing locals that
have never been alive is that wholly bogus and sometimes lengthy
values may be printed because such a value happens to be in the
location that will later hold the value of the live local. We are not
going to repeat that example (see the discussion above under the
heading 
<a href="#locals-debug-one-two-problems-2">Section 6.11 Problem with debug=1 and debug=2 behavior before a local has a value</a>).
</p>

<p id="221">
More interesting than bogus values is what happens when all the
locals associated with a register (on machines where registers are
used to store locals) that is used for locals are dead. In our
<strong>loc-fun</strong> example, this happens at break3. <em>a</em>,
<em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>e</em> are all dead and
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are alive. <em>x</em> uses register 1 and
<em>y</em> uses register 2 but both values that use register 3
(<em>a</em> and <em>e</em>) are dead. We compile
<strong>loc-fun</strong> at debug=3 and move to break3:

has no way of knowing which of the identified dead locals had the
indicated value (we know it is <em>e</em> by examining the code). The
value is always the value of the last local to have died (assuming
they were ever alive).</p>

<p id="224">On machines where locals are stored on the stack and locations are
not shared, each local has a location and the value associated with a

<p id="227">The <a href="tpl-commands/boe.htm"><b>:boe</b></a> command allows you to
break on exit, that is to stop execution when a frame is returned
from.</p>

<p id="228">Here is an example of using the <a href="tpl-commands/boe.htm"><b>:boe</b></a> command.</p>





<hr><hr><h2 id="229"><a name="return-and-restart-1">8.0 :return and :restart</a></h2>

<p id="230">The top-level commands <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a>
and <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> both attempt to
restart evaluation of a broken process from the current frame (see
<a href="tpl-commands/current.htm"><b>:current</b></a>). <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a> sequentially evaluates the
arguments provided and returns their values from the current stack
frame. The function associated with the current stack frame is not
executed, and its arguments are not again evaluated. </p>

<p id="231">The <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a> command is useful
in situations similar to the following. Suppose that in your code you
had taken the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/log.htm"><b>log</b></a> of a value
when you meant to take the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/expexpt.htm"><b>exp</b></a>
of the value. If you make the call to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/log.htm"><b>log</b></a> be the current stack frame, then typing </p>

<pre id="232">
:return (exp value) 
</pre>

<p id="233">will cause the computation to continue as if the code were correct
to begin with, that is, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/expexpt.htm"><b>exp</b></a> of
value will be calculated and returned from the current frame.  The
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/log.htm"><b>log</b></a> function will not be
re-executed. </p>

<p id="234"><a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> works on frame
objects. A frame object is a list whose first element is a function
and whose remaining elements are the <i>evaluated</i> arguments to the
function. The top-level command <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> prints a backtrace of the current
execution stack. If <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> is
printing in moderate mode, it prints frame objects. (In brief mode, it
simply prints the function name. In verbose mode, more than the frame
object is printed.) <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> and
related commands (:find, :dn, :up, :top, etc.) all display the stack
and identify one stack frame as the current stack frame.  The value of
the lisp variable * is set to the identified frame as part of the
action of <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> or a related
command. Thus, if <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> is
printing in moderate mode, * will be set to a frame object after
<a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> or a related command
completes. </p>

<p id="235">The argument to the <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a>
command must evaluate to a frame object (or <code>nil</code>, indicating that the current frame object should
be used unchanged). Calling <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> restarts computation, replacing
the current frame with the argument frame and continuing from
there. Contrast this with <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a>
which returns from a frame with a specified value (but does not
re-evaluate the current frame). The two commands, <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a> and <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> can behave quite differently. We
will give an example below. </p>

<p id="236">As an example of <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> called
with no arguments, suppose you define the following functions: </p>

<pre id="237">
(defun baz (n) (bar (+ n 3)))
  (defun bar (n) (+ (goo n) 5))
  (defun foo (x) (* x x)) 
</pre>

<p id="238">We have misspelled <em>foo</em> as <em>goo</em> in the definition
of bar. If we evaluate </p>

<pre id="239">
(baz 7)
</pre>

<p id="240">we get an error since <strong>goo</strong> is undefined. The stack
as printed by <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> contains the
frame </p>

<pre id="241">
(bar 10)
</pre>

<p id="242">We can then correct the definition of <strong>bar</strong> and load
in just the new definition using the Emacs-Lisp interface. Next, if we
make </p>

<pre id="243">
(bar 10) 
</pre>

<p id="244">the current frame (using <a href="tpl-commands/dn.htm"><b>:dn</b></a> or
<a href="tpl-commands/find.htm"><b>:find</b></a>), we can call <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> without arguments (or with
<code>nil</code> as an argument) and the computation will
continue, returning the correct answer (105). </p>

<p id="245">As an example of calling <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> with an argument, consider the
following. Suppose <strong>bar</strong> and <strong>foo</strong> are
defined as: </p>

<pre id="246">
(defun bar () (+ (hoo 1 2 3) (hoo 4 5 6)))
  (defun foo (a b c) (+ a b c)) 
</pre>

<p id="247">Here, the call to <strong>hoo</strong> in <strong>bar</strong> is a
misprint: it should be a call to <strong>foo</strong>. If we evaluate
<code>(bar)</code>, we again get an undefined function error. If we
call <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> (with its :all argument
specified as <code>t</code> so all frames are printed), we
see the following frame: </p>

<pre id="248">
(excl::%eval (+ (hoo 1 2 3) (hoo 4 5 6))) 
</pre>

<p id="249">(You may have to set the values of <a href="variables/tpl/s_zoom-print-level_s.htm"><code>*zoom-print-level*</code></a> and <a href="variables/tpl/s_zoom-print-length_s.htm"><code>*zoom-print-length*</code></a> to
<code>nil</code> to get the entire frame without # marks
or suspension points.) If we make that frame the current frame (so it
is the value of <code>cl:*</code>) and then evaluate </p>

<pre id="250">
:restart (subst 'foo 'hoo *) 
</pre>

<p id="251">the frame will be re-evaluated so that <strong>foo</strong> is
called rather than <strong>hoo</strong> and the correct result (21)
will be returned. </p>

<p id="252">The argument to <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> must
evaluate to a frame object and the `arguments' in a frame object (the
elements of the cdr) will not be further evaluated. Thus the following
are not equivalent: </p>

<pre id="253">
(+ 1 2 3 5)
  (+ 1 2 3 (- 6 1)) 
</pre>

<p id="254">The first will evaluate correctly. The second will bomb since a
list is not a legal argument to +. </p>

<p id="255">One might think at first that <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a> called with a frame object and
<a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a> called with a form which,
when the arguments are evaluated, is the same since the frame object
will have the same result. This is not, however, correct. </p>

<p id="256">The bindings set up on the stack are (in some cases) handled
differently by the two <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a>
and <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a>. Like many binding
issues in Lisp, the example is not immediately intuitive (at least to
Lisp beginners). Let us give an example and then discuss it. Consider
the following functions: </p>

<pre id="257">
(defun bar () 
  (let ((*special* 1))
    (declare (special *special*))
    (foo 5)))
(defun foo (x) 
  (let ((*special* (1+ *special*)))
    (declare (special *special*))
    (if (eq x 5) (break "sorry, bad number") *special*))) 
</pre>

<p id="258">When we evaluate <code>(bar)</code>, <strong>foo</strong>
will be called with argument 5 and break will put Lisp into a break
loop. We decide to go to the frame where <strong>foo</strong> is
called and recall <strong>foo</strong> with a different argument. Here
is the stack after the break. We go down two frames to reach the frame
where <strong>foo</strong> is called. </p>

that ghost frames are not displayed because the disassembler is not

<hr><h2 id="279"><a name="what-is-ghost-2">9.2 What is a ghost frame?</a></h2>

<p id="280">Typically, Lisp executes a series of function calls. It maintains a
stack of function call frames that show the sequence of functions,
each calling the next, that resulted in the current state of
Lisp. However, compiled code may cause the frames associated with
functions actually called to be removed from the stack. Doing so makes
code run faster but means that a backtrace (displayed by the top-level
commands <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> and <a href="tpl-commands/bt.htm"><b>:bt</b></a>) does not show calls to some functions
actually called, thus making debugging more difficult. </p>

<p id="281">The debugger will where possible insert frames into a backtrace to
indicate either that a specific function was called but optimization
has removed the associated frame from the stack or that some function
was called and removed from the stack by optimization although the
debugger cannot determine exactly which function.</p>

<p id="282">These inserted frames are called <i><b>ghost frames</b></i>. They
are indicated in moderate or verbose printed backtraces by being
surrounded with brackets ([]). Consider the following backtraces. The
first shows the interpreted code. The second shows compiled code at
maximum optimization. The <code>[... foo]</code> frame in the
second backtrace is a ghost frame, indicating that there was a call to
<strong>foo</strong> whose associated frame is no longer on the
stack. The suspension points (`...') further indicate that other
functions were called whose associated frames have been removed from
the stack, although the debugger cannot determine which ones (we of
course know from the interpreted backtrace that the missing functions
are <strong>bar</strong> and <strong>baz</strong>):</p>

<pre id="283">
; Interpreted code backtrace:
  (error type-error :datum ...)
-&gt;(list-length 1)
  (baz 1)
  (bar 1)
  (foo 1)
  (start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))
 
; Compiled code backtrace:
  (error type-error :datum ...)
-&gt;(list-length 1)
  [... foo]
  (start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="284"><a name="optimizations-causing-ghost-2">9.3 What kinds of optimizations cause ghost frames?</a></h2>

<p id="285">
Frames get removed from the stack by a compiler optimization called
non-self tail merging. Consider the following example (which generated
the backtraces shown above when compiled with speed 2, debug 1):
</p>

<pre id="286">
(defun start-fun (x) (foo x) nil)
(defun foo (x) (print x) (bar x))
(defun bar (x) (princ x) (baz x))
(defun baz (x) (pprint x) (list-length x))
</pre>

<p id="287">
The error for which the backtrace is displayed above occurs when
the form <code>(start-fun 1)</code> is evaluated. 1 is not a
legal argument to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a>
(which expects a list) and so an error is signaled.
</p>

<p id="288">This is a pretty trivial example but it is not uncharacteristic of
real code. <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and
<strong>baz</strong> each accepts an argument, does something with the
argument, and then passes the argument to the next
function. <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and
<strong>baz</strong> each has the property that once the system has
reached the last form, nothing further is required of the
function. </p>

<p id="289">Thus, <strong>foo</strong> calls <strong>print</strong> and then
calls <strong>bar</strong>.  <strong>foo</strong> is going to return
whatever <strong>bar</strong> returns and there are no possible side
effects that are not caused by <strong>bar</strong>. At the point
where <strong>foo</strong> calls <strong>bar</strong>, there is no
reason for a frame associated with <strong>foo</strong> to be on the
stack, except for debugging. Indeed, keeping the frame on the stack
causes the stack to grow more than is absolutely necessary and, when
<strong>bar</strong> returns, causes extra instructions (to exit from
<strong>foo</strong>) to be executed. Things would run faster if the
frame associated with <strong>foo</strong> were simply removed from
the stack and the system acted as if <strong>start-fun</strong> had
called <strong>bar</strong> directly (the print called for in
<strong>foo</strong> has already been completed by the time
<strong>bar</strong> is called). </p>

<p id="290">The compiler will optimize this code to remove frames as described
as long as the compiler optimization qualities safety, space, speed,
and debug have values such that the switch <a href="variables/compiler/tail-call-non-self-merge-switch.htm"><code>tail-call-non-self-merge-switch</code></a> is
true. In that case, the compiler will generate code which will make
the stack look as if the functions were defined as follows:</p>

<pre id="291">
(defun start-fun (x)
  (foo x)
  (bar x)
  (baz x)
  (list-length x))
(defun foo (x) (print x))
(defun bar (x) (princ x))
(defun baz (x) (pprint x))
</pre>

<p id="292">This code will run faster and suppress unnecessary stack growth but
the stack will not reflect the actual sequence of function
calls. Thus, when <strong>start-fun</strong> is called with the
argument 1, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> will
signal an error because its argument is not a list and the backtraces
shown above will result.</p>

<p id="293">Compiler optimization switches in general and <a href="variables/compiler/tail-call-non-self-merge-switch.htm"><code>tail-call-non-self-merge-switch</code></a> in
particular are described in <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>.</p>



<hr><h2 id="294"><a name="how-does-debugger-know-about-ghost-2">9.4 How does the debugger know about ghost frames?</a></h2>

<p id="295">Since all references to <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>,
and <strong>baz</strong> in our example have disappeared from the
stack by the time Lisp enters a break loop (when <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> signals an error), the information
on the stack is insufficient to print ghost frames. One piece of
information, is available, however: the location to which control
should return in <strong>start-fun</strong> when <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> has completed. The debugger can
access that return location and can (assuming the disassembler has
been loaded) disassemble the code for the function named by
<strong>start-fun</strong>. Looking at that disassembly, the debugger
can determine that the return location is just after a call to
<strong>foo</strong>. </p>

<p id="296">Therefore, it knows that <strong>foo</strong> was called but the
<strong>foo</strong> frame has been optimized off the stack. From that
information, the debugger generates the <strong>foo</strong> ghost
frame.</p>

<p id="297">The debugger also knows that some function must have called
<strong>list-length</strong> (since the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> frame is still on the
stack). Examining the disassembly of <strong>foo</strong> shows that
<strong>foo</strong> could not have called <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> itself and so the debugger also
knows that at least one other function must have been called between
<strong>foo</strong> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> (we know that <strong>bar</strong>
and <strong>baz</strong> were called). Therefore, the debugger puts
the suspension points in the ghost frame to indicate the missing ghost
frames ([... foo]). However, the debugger is not able to tell which
function called by <strong>foo</strong> called <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a>.</p>



<hr><h2 id="298"><a name="displaying-ghost-2">9.5 When will the debugger display ghost frames?</a></h2>

<p id="299">In order for the debugger to determine that frames have been
optimized off the stack, it must have access to the disassembler. The
disassembler in Allegro CL is not included as part of the base
system. Instead, it is loaded when needed, typically when the function
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/disassem.htm"><b>disassemble</b></a> is called.</p>

<p id="300">When the disassembler is loaded, the system adds the string
"disasm" to the list that is the value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/modules.htm"><code>*modules*</code></a>. The debugger will not
load the disassembler just to print ghost frames. So, when the
disassembler is loaded, the debugger will print ghost frames in
backtraces. When the disassembler is not loaded, the debugger will not
print such frames. In that case, the following message will be printed
at the end of the backtrace:</p>

<pre id="301">
(to see any ghost frames, the disassembler must be loaded)
</pre>



<hr><h2 id="302"><a name="returning-from-ghost-2">9.6 Can I return from or restart a ghost frame?</a></h2>

<p id="303">The short answer is no. Various debugger commands in Allegro CL
operate on the current frame. These include <a href="tpl-commands/restart.htm"><b>:restart</b></a>, <a href="tpl-commands/return.htm"><b>:return</b></a>, <a href="tpl-commands/current.htm"><b>:current</b></a>, <a href="tpl-commands/local.htm"><b>:local</b></a>, etc. Since ghost frames are not
really on the stack, applying these commands to a ghost frame does not
make sense. In fact, it is not possible to make a ghost frame the
current frame. Here is the backtrace shown above:</p>

<pre id="304">
  (error type-error :datum ...)
-&gt;(list-length 1)
  [... foo]
  (start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))
</pre>

<p id="305">The arrow (-&gt;) indicates the current frame is the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> frame. If you call the
command <a href="tpl-commands/dn.htm"><b>:dn</b></a> (which moves the
current frame down one frame on the stack), the display changes as
follows:</p>

<pre id="306">
  (error type-error :datum ...)
  (list-length 1)
  [... foo]
-&gt;(start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))  
</pre>

<p id="307">That is, the ghost frame is skipped and the next real frame, the
<strong>start-fun</strong> frame, becomes the current frame.</p>



<hr><h2 id="308"><a name="suspension-points-in-ghost-2">9.7 What do the suspension points (`...') mean in a ghost frame?</a></h2>

<p id="309">
The backtrace shown just above indicates the ghost frame
<code>[... foo]</code>. The suspension points indicate that
other functions were called between <strong>foo</strong> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a>, although the debugger
does not know what these functions are.
</p>

<p id="310">
As described under the heading
<a href="#how-does-debugger-know-about-ghost-2">Section 9.4 How does the debugger know about ghost frames?</a>
above, the debugger can sometimes tell that a ghost frame belongs in
the stack and that the function associated with the ghost frame cannot
have called the function associated with the next real frame on the
stack. Thus, in our example, the debugger can tell that a
<strong>foo</strong> frame must have been on the stack (so it adds a
ghost frame) and can further tell <strong>foo</strong> did not call
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> (and so adds
suspension points to the ghost frame).
</p>



<hr><h2 id="311"><a name="no-suspension-points-in-ghost-2">9.8 The ghost frame has no `...'s; are all possible frames displayed?</a></h2>

<p id="312">
We have already said that suspension points (`...') indicate that
other functions were called between the ghost frame and the next real
frame. However, if there are no suspension points, you cannot
immediately conclude that no other functions were called.
</p>

<p id="313">
Consider the following modification of our example above. Instead
of defining <strong>foo</strong> this way:
</p>

<pre id="314">
(defun foo (x) (print x) (bar x))
</pre>

<p id="315">we define it as follows:</p>

<pre id="316">
(defun foo (x) (let ((y (list-length (list x)))) (print y)) (bar x))
</pre>

<p id="317">(Again, a trivial example since y is obviously 1.) We compile
<strong>foo</strong> again and again evaluate <code>(start-fun
1)</code>. Again, we get an error (from the call to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> in <strong>baz</strong>)
and the following backtrace is displayed:</p>

<pre id="318">
  (error type-error :datum ...)
-&gt;(list-length 1)
  [foo]
  (start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))
</pre>

<p id="319">Here, the ghost frame for <strong>foo</strong> has no suspension
points even though we know that <strong>foo</strong> called
<strong>bar</strong> called <strong>baz</strong> called
<strong>list-length</strong>, where the error occurred. However,
because <strong>foo</strong> itself calls <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/list-len.htm"><b>list-length</b></a> (for a different purpose), the
debugger could not conclude that <strong>foo</strong> did not call
<strong>list-length</strong> with an argument which resulted in an
error.</p>

<p id="320">Therefore, suspension points indicate missing ghost frames for
sure. No suspension points does not by itself mean there are no
missing ghost frames.</p>



<hr><h2 id="321"><a name="no-ghost-displayed-2">9.9 No ghost frames are displayed. Do all functions appear on the stack?</a></h2>

<p id="322">
First, some functions are hidden by the system from backtraces to
avoid unnecessary clutter. These functions are printed when <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> is called with arguments
<code>:all t</code>.
</p>

<p id="323">
However, ghost frames may also be missing in cases similar to our
example. Suppose <strong>start-fun</strong>, which was originally
defined (in
<a href="#no-suspension-points-in-ghost-2">Section 9.8 The ghost frame has no `...'s; are all possible frames displayed?</a>) above:
</p>

<pre id="324">
  (defun start-fun (x) (foo x) nil)
</pre>

<p id="325">was instead defined as follows:</p>

<pre id="326">
  (defun start-fun (x) (funcall 'foo x) nil)
</pre>

<p id="327">Again, we evaluate <code>(start-fun 1)</code> and do a
<a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a>. The following backtrace is
printed:</p>

<pre id="328">
  (error type-error :datum ...)
-&gt;(list-length 1)
  (start-fun 1)
  (eval (start-fun 1))
</pre>

<p id="329">The moral of this and the information under the previous heading,
therefore, is that printed information is always guaranteed but
missing information should not be depended upon to accurately reflect
the situation.</p>



<hr><h2 id="330"><a name="ghost-in-brief-2">9.10 Ghost frames in a brief backtrace</a></h2>

<p id="331">
Calling <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> with arguments
<code>:brief t</code> or calling the <a href="tpl-commands/bt.htm"><b>:bt</b></a> command prints an abbreviated
backtrace. Here is roughly what is printed when <a href="tpl-commands/bt.htm"><b>:bt</b></a> is called after evaluating
<code>(start-fun 1)</code>. The original definitions of
<strong>foo</strong> and <b>start-fun</b> are in

<p id="335">

<hr><h2 id="338"><a name="system-functions-and-ghost-2">9.12 Can backtraces involving system functions have ghost frames?</a></h2>

<p id="339">Yes, they can. Many system (i.e. predefined) functions in Allegro
CL are compiled at a settings of speed and debug which cause <a href="variables/compiler/tail-call-non-self-merge-switch.htm"><code>tail-call-non-self-merge-switch</code></a> to be
true. Therefore, it is possible that ghost frames can appear
identified with symbols naming system functions.</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="342"><a name="tracer-1">10.0 The tracer</a></h2>

<p id="343">
The tracer provides a way to track or trace when functions are
called. For example, when tracing a function, a message is printed
upon entering and exiting the function.
</p>

<p id="344">
The tracer is invoked at the top level using <a href="tpl-commands/trace.htm"><b>:trace</b></a> and turned off using <a href="tpl-commands/untrace.htm"><b>:untrace</b></a>. The tracer can also be invoked
and exited using the macros <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/traceunt.htm"><b>trace</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/traceunt.htm"><b>untrace</b></a>, which have the same argument syntax as
their top-level command counterparts.
</p>

<p id="345">
The output from <a href="tpl-commands/trace.htm"><b>:trace</b></a> is designed
to be readable - a function being traced may be called many times, and
the entrance and exit from each instance should be obvious, by the
numbers at the beginning of the lines and the indentation of the lines
printed by the traced function. Also printed at the beginning is a
number in brackets, such as [1]. This number indicates the process and
can be associated with an actual process by looking at the information

A couple of notes on tracing in the IDE
</h4>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li id="347">
<b>Output normally goes to the trace dialog</b>: if you are using the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with Allegro CL on Windows,
trace output will go to the Trace dialog if that dialog is available,
whether or not it is visible or iconified. (Output will go to that
dialog if it exists and its state, as returned by <a href="operators/cg/s/state.htm"><b>state</b></a>, is <code>:normal</code>,
<code>:maximized</code>, or <code>:icon</code>. Output
will go to the Debug window if the Trace dialog does not exist or has
state <code>:shrunk</code>. Click on the close button of the
Trace dialog if you want output to go to the Debug window.
</li>

<li id="348">
<b>Tracing in event code can be suppressed for a specific
window</b>. If the generic function <a href="operators/cg/i/inhibit-trace-for-object.htm"><b>inhibit-trace-for-object</b></a> returns true for a
particular window, then tracing will be suppressed for code that runs
in event-handling callbacks for that window.  This could be useful for
eliminating extraneous trace output that would otherwise be generated
for tool windows that you are not testing.

<p id="358">
A call to function <b>foo</b> is <i>inside</i> a call to function
<b>bar</b> if <b>bar</b> appears on the stack when <b>foo</b> is
called. <b>bar</b> can call <b>foo</b> directly, meaning there is an
explicit call to <b>foo</b> in the code defining <b>bar</b>, or
indirectly, meaning <b>bar</b> calls another function which (perhaps
calls more itermediate functions) which calls <b>foo</b> directly.
</p>
<p id="359">
There are a few special cases. One is caused by tail-merging. Thus,
if <b>bar</b> calls <b>baz</b> which does a tail-merged call to
<b>foo</b>, then <b>foo</b> is considered inside <b>bar</b> but not
inside <b>baz</b>.
</p>
<p id="360">
The other special case is generic functions. If a method is on the
stack, its generic function is also considered to be on the stack,
even though it never will be seen there (meaning you can specify the
generic function rather than the specific method). Thus the following
all work for tracing <b>foo</b> inside a call to <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> called on a
<code>terminal-simple-stream</code>, but the first will
catch calls to <b>foo</b> inside any <a href="operators/excl/device-read.htm"><b>device-read</b></a> method.

<b><p id="376">Tracting compiled code</p></b>

<p id="377">
Note that the factorial function is recursive. When traced
interpreted, all the calls made during the evaluation are shown. But
the behavior when compiled may be different since on some
architectures, self-calls by recursive functions are compiled in such
a way that they avoid going through the normal function calling
sequence (which is not necessary on such platforms, and so unnecessary
instructions can be avoided). Because since the tracer catches
function calls from the normal function calling sequence, it will not
see most of the recursive self calls and it will look like the
function was called only once. See
the <a href="http://franz.com/support/faq/#tracerecurse">Why doesn't
tracing a self-calling function trace the inner calls?</a> FAQ iten in
the <a href="http://franz.com/support/faq/">Allegro CL FAQ</a> for
more information. Compilation may also affect trace output in other
ways. You always get maximum information by tracing interpreted code.

<p id="381">
Methods and internal functions are typically named by function specs
(see <a href="implementation.htm#function-specs-1">Function specs (fspecs)</a> in
<a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>). This section describes how
to trace such things, concetrating on setf, :before and :after methods

</p>
<p id="382">
Here is how to trace <b>setf</b>, :before and :after methods. Note
that the methods must be defined before they can be traced (we have
not done that -- the examples simply show the format of the calls to

<p id="384">The extra set of parentheses is required to avoid confusion with
specifying trace options (they are specified with a list whose car is
the function to be traced and whose cdr is a possibly empty list of
options). Note that the extra set of parentheses is not used with

<p id="392">
The memlog module is a trace facility which stores data in an internal
data structure rather than printing it. This can be useful in any Lisp
but is particularly useful in an SMP lisp as it mitigates the problem
of coordinating output and the problem of affecting operation because
of the I/O cost. It is documented in <a href="smp.htm">smp.htm</a> in the section
<a href="smp.htm#memlog-1">Memlog: A Facility for
Minimally Intrusive Monitoring of Complex Application
Behavior</a>.
</p>





<hr><hr><h2 id="393"><a name="stepper-1">11.0 The original stepper</a></h2>

<p id="394">
The stepper described in this section is triggered by
the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/step.htm"><b>step</b></a> macro and
associated tools. There is also a separate, modern stepper, the Lisp
DeBug (LDB) stepper, which is described below in two sections. The
first section, <a href="#ldb-stepper-1">Section 12.0 The Lisp DeBug (ldb) stepper</a> describes
the LDB stepper itself, and the second
section, <a href="#source-step-1">Section 13.0 The source stepper</a> describes its
source stepping variant. The LDB stepper is not related to the
original stepper described in this section and its subsections. We
recommend that users consider using that more modern tool before
using the original stepper.
</p>
<p id="395">
The stepper allows the user to watch and control the evaluation of
Lisp expressions, either inside certain functions or over certain
expressions. When stepping is turned on, evaluation of all expressions
is done in single-step mode - after evaluating one form, a step
read-eval-print loop is entered, from which the user may continue or
abort. 
</p>
<p id="396">
It is only useful to step through <b>compiled code</b>. You cannot
effectively step through interpreted code. (Doing so results in
stepping through the interpreter itself, with hundreds of
uninteresting steps). Further, see <a href="variables/compiler/verify-funcalls-switch.htm"><code>verify-funcalls-switch</code></a>. <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a>'ed functions in certain cases
in compiled code will not be caught by the stepper if the call was
compiled with that compiler switch false.
</p>
<p id="397">
<strong>If you ever see the entry</strong>
</p>
<pre id="398">
&lt;excl::interpreted-funcall ...&gt;
</pre>
<p id="399">
<strong>immediately enter the command <a href="tpl-commands/sover.htm"><b>:sover</b></a>.</strong>
</p>
<p id="400">
If you instead take another step (by hitting Return, for example),
get out of stepping by entering
</p>
<pre id="401">
[step] cl-user(20): :step nil
[step] cl-user(21): :sover
</pre>
<p id="402">
and then you can start stepping afresh.
</p>

 

<p id="403">
The <a href="tpl-commands/step.htm"><b>:step</b></a> top-level command is
similar to the standard Common Lisp macro step. 
</p>

<p id="404">
With no arguments or an argument of <code>nil</code>,
<a href="tpl-commands/step.htm"><b>:step</b></a> turns off stepping. With an
argument of <code>t</code>, stepping is turned on
globally. Otherwise the arguments must be symbols naming functions,
and stepping is done only when inside one of the functions given to
:step.
</p>

<p id="405">Once stepping is turned on, the top level recognizes three more
commands: :scont, :sover, and carriage return (which is a
synonym for <a href="tpl-commands/scont.htm"><b>:scont</b></a> 1). Also, the
top-level prompt for read-eval-print loops when stepping is enabled is
prefixed with [step],
as a reminder that the above step commands are available. </p>

<hr><h2 id="406"><a name="turning-stepping-off-2">11.1 Turning stepping off</a></h2>

<p id="407">
Entering <code>:step nil</code> turns off stepping. You may have
to then enter <code>:sover</code> to end the current stepping
through a function. Turning off stepping is very useful when
you accidently start stepping through an interpreted function.

<p id="433">
<b>The source stepper is not available on the Sparc platform.</b>
</p>

<p id="434">
Note there are two steppers in Allegro CL, the original stepper
(associated with the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/step.htm"><b>step</b></a> macro) and described in the
section <a href="#stepper-1">Section 11.0 The original stepper</a> above, and the LDB
stepper descibed in part in the
section <a href="#ldb-stepper-1">Section 12.0 The Lisp DeBug (ldb) stepper</a> above. The source
variant of the LDB stepper is described in this section. We recommend
that users start with the LDB stepper, which is more powerful that the
original stepper.
</p>

<p id="435">
The source stepper displays source code while stepping through a
form. In the IDE, the source stepper is associated with the
new <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper
Dialog</a>. It can also be run in terminal mode as described
here.
</p>
<p id="436">
In order for information to be available to the source stepper,
files must be compiled while the compiler
switch <a href="variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a>
returns true, which it initially does whenever the debug optimization
quality is 3.
</p>
<p id="437">
When <a href="variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a> is
true, the compiler writes annotation information to the fasl file it
produces. It does not produce different code: the same code is
produced regardless of the value of <a href="variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a>. But
when the swicth is true, the annotations added to the fasl file make
the fasl file bigger.
</p>
<p id="438">
The annotated file should be loaded while the
variable <a href="variables/excl/s_load-source-file-info_s.htm"><code>*load-source-file-info*</code></a> is true, but the
system will prompt for the name of the necessary file if the
information is not loaded when the fasl file is loaded. If the
annotated file is loaded while <a href="variables/excl/s_load-source-debug-info_s.htm"><code>*load-source-debug-info*</code></a> is true, then
the source debug information will be also loaded into Lisp at that
time. This is not recommended since the information is voluminous and
may not be needed, but if you have problems with ensuring that the
information is loaded, loading while that variable is true ensures
it.
</p>
<p id="439">
We illustrate the interface with a simple example. The
function <b>foo</b> is defined in the file <b>step.cl</b>:
</p>

<pre id="440">

</pre>

<p id="441">
As the transcript shows, we set the value of the debug optimize
quality to 3, then compile step.cl and load step.fasl. We then put a
breakpoint at foo and start the ldb debugger. Then we call foo. As we
step through, the form being executed is shown. Note that the

slide options
</h2>
<p id="444">
At each step, you are given some slide options, such as <b>over</b>,
<b>into</b>, <b>across</b>, <b>out</b>, and <b>back</b>. Not all
options are available at every step. You can use
the <a href="tpl-commands/slide.htm"><b>:slide</b></a> top-level command with
the type of sliding or the <a href="tpl-commands/step.htm"><b>:step</b></a>
command at the prompt.
</p>
<p id="445">
In general, sliding is a conceptual way to navigate around a function,
in spite of the fact that there is no mouse to point to select the
form you want (with the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper Dialog</a> in the IDE, you can use
the mouse to indicate what you wish to do). In the tty interface, the
<a href="tpl-commands/slide.htm"><b>:slide</b></a> command is the mechanism.
The :slide command does not alter the state of computation (that is
done with actions like a carriage return or <code>:step cont</code>) but
rather affects what form is being examined.

<hr><hr><h2 id="446"><a name="func-meta-1">14.0 Printing function meta data are related topics</a></h2>

<p id="447">
The functions validate-lisp-source and print-function-meta-info print
information about function definitions, compilation and debugging. The
information is complex. The following sections describe aspects of the
output and so provide a single description for things done by various
functions.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="448"><a name="source-record-desc-2">14.1 Source record description</a></h2>

<p id="449">
A source record is printed specially by <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a>, because source
records serve as breakpoints and the ldb-code struct which implements
a source record inherits from the breakpoint struct.  Each of these
structs print differently (more concisely) when using their
print-object methods.  When <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> is called
with <i>:mixed</i> or <i>:vars</i>
non-<code>nil</code> and available, each source record
line is prepended with "S", otherwise no "S" is prepended.  Before the
first record. a header is printed, which gives a general feel for the
alignments of fields.  Not all fields align perfectly on every record:
some fields are longer than others.  For orientation, a vertical bar
(|) is placed between fields in two places, thus dividing the record
into 3 sections.
</p>
<p id="450">
Below is a chart of slot names and their field names in the printout.
Also present is an indication of whether the field represents a
breakpoint slot (otherwise it is a lisp record slot).  Note that some
field names are duplicated; they are short to save space and the
correct sense can easily be seen by what section the field is in

Slot/Field descriptions
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="453">
<b>ics-passa</b>: 
the first column (without the initial S character) or the second
column (with the S character) is either blank, a +, or a -.  Blank
indicates no ics (16-bit vs 8 bit character set) distinction; the
function is designed to run with either character width.  For records
with - in the ics-passa column, the function can only be run in 8-bit
character set lisps, and with a + in that column, the function can
only be run in a 16-bit character-set lisp.  In any one lisp you
should only to expect to see one of two characters in any
print-function-meta-info output: either a blank or the character that
corresponds to the correct character width.
</li>
<li id="454">
<b>index</b>: the ix column shows the index of the record in the record set for this
function.  Note that several related functions might be associated
with the same record set; for example, a parent function and its flet
internal functions would all have the same source record set, so not
all first records begin with a 0 index.
</li>
<li id="455">
<b>level</b>: the level field is really two fields: a minimum and a
maximum.  These values provide boundaries on the macroexpand level on
which this record may rise.  Every macroexpansion constitutes an
increment in the level.  If the min and max are the same only one
level is printed.
<p id="456">
Level 0 records are special; any record which has 0 as its min level
is a record which corresponds to actual source code.  These records
should also have character position information.
</p>
</li>
<li id="457">
<b>prev-rec</b>, <b>next-rec</b>, and <b>branch-rec</b>: the prev
field shows the index of the record which immediately precedes this
one. Next (nxt) and branch (br) in the <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> output, these fields
specify one or more indexes each indicating where execution might
continue from here.
</li>
<li id="458">
<b>enclosing</b>: the enclosing field is the index of the record which
immediately encloses this record.  In a sense, the field points to the
next more outer form.
</li>
<li id="459">
<b>end</b>: if this record is a special operator or a binding form,
the end field will point to the next form after this form, lexically.
</li>
<li id="460">
<b>parent</b> and <b>child</b>: Like the next and branch fields, the
parent ("par") and child ("chld") fields are each an index, indicating
a macroexpansion relationship.  The child field indicates that this
record is a macro form: the child field indexes the record which
represents the form this form expanded to (each expansion is a single
macroexpansion, as with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/macroex0.htm"><b>macroexpand-1</b></a> or
<b>excl::compiler-macroexpand-1</b>).  The parent field indexes the
parent, and each pair always reference each other.  If the child
record is also a macro form, it will also have a child record which
indexes a third record, which will in turn point back to it via the
parent field.
</li>
<li id="461">
<b>pc</b>, <b>next-pc</b> and <b>branch-pc</b>: labelled "pc", "nxt",
and "br" in the second half of each record in <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> output, these
values are actual relative program-counter values.  A record has only
one pc field, and may have 0 or more next-pc and branch-pc fields,
depending on the branch-type.
</li>
<li id="462">
<b>entry-type</b>:  this field describes in a keyword what
kind of record this is.  <code>nil</code> in this field
means that there is no special consideration for this record.  A
non-exhaustive list of entry-types is:
<ul>
<li id="463">
<code>:ref</code> - A variable is being referenced.
</li>
<li id="464">
<code>:call</code> - A call to a function is about to occur;
arguments have already been placed.
</li>
<li id="465">
<code>:early</code> - A call to a function is being considered,
but arguments have not yet been placed.
</li>
<li id="466">
<code>:clone</code> - assembler code has split off into two or
more branches in implementing this form, and this record is a copy of
a previous record.
</li>
<li id="467">
<code>:init</code> - This record represents the storing of an
initialization form into a variable being bound by a <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/letlet.htm"><b>let</b></a> form.
</li>
<li id="468">
<code>:setq</code> - A variable is about to be <b>setq</b>'d.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="469">
<b>branch-type</b>: this field describes what the branching
characteristics are of this record.  If the field is nil, then no
branching occurs; the record only contains one next or branch field,
and thus only one next-pc or branch-pc field.  A non-exhaustive list
of branch-types is:
<ul>
<li id="470">
<code>:bcc</code> - Branch on Condition Code: A decision will be
made whether to branch or not.  A next and branch field will always be
present.
</li>
<li id="471">
<code>:jmp</code> - branch unconditionally: Usually the
branch/branch-pc fields will point to the target record/pc, and there
will be no next/next-pc fields.
</li>
<li id="472">
<code>:call</code> - A call to a function. The function is
determined by what is in the function name register, and a decision
about whether to break at the beginning of that function is determined
by the step type.  The next fields will be filled in with the next
record after the call, unless it is a tail-call.
</li>
<li id="473">
<code>:ret</code> - This record is a return record; there are no
next or branch fields.
</li>
<li id="474">
<code>:case</code> - This record represents a table-calculated
jump, which may have next fields but always has multiple branch
fields.
</li>
<li id="475">
<code>:noreturn</code> - This record represents dead code, which
will not be returned to (e.g. by a tail call).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="476">
<b>start-char</b>: if the st field is filled in it represents the
absolute 0-indexed character-position of the start of this form in its
source file.  If the field is a list of one integer, then it
represents the macro which fully replaces the form starting at the
same position.  Multiple macroexpanded records might have the same
start char as the highest parent in the chain, and all but that
highest parent will have the start char in list form.
</li>
<li id="477">
<b>end-char</b>: end is just like st, only when present it represents
the character just past the closing parenthesis of the form.  Like st,
it may be a list of one integer, which represents a macroexpansion
which precisely replaces the original macro form.
</li>
<li id="478">
<b>source</b>: the form field is the a copy of the actual source for
the current record.  It is not the identical source that was read,
because it went through a fasl writing/reading process to get to its
current state.  But all sharing os preserved within any fasl file, so
subforms in different records may be eq to each other.
</li>
</ul>

<li id="487">
<b>hex data</b>: bytes of data which comprise the instruction stream.
This may be pronted as individual bytes, shorts, or 32-bit ints,
depending on the architecture. If more data is required for one

</li>
<li id="488">
<b>real mnemonic</b>: sometimes, especially on RISC architectures, a
specific combination of bits might be interpreted as a specialized
instruction.  For example, "and r1, r1, 0" might be the real
instruction but the understood instruction for this case might be "clr
r0".  In this example "and" is the real mnemonic and is printed in
square brackets.
</li>
<li id="489">
<b>mnemonic</b>: the accepted mnemonic instruction name for this

</ul>



<hr><h2 id="492"><a name="var-trans-rec-2">14.3 Variable transition record description</a></h2>

<p id="493">
A variable transition is always printed as an object, using the

<a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a>

positioned in a column that generally aligns the pc value with other
values in the <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> output.
</p>
<p id="494">
Fields that are printed are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="495">
<b>pc=x</b> - this is the program counter that effects the transition.
Sometimes this corresponds to actual data movement in the
corresponding instruction, and sometimes it simply represents data
that is no longer available, either from being overwritten by another
variable or else simply no longer being visible.
</li>
<li id="496">
<b>trans=X</b> - describes the transtion type.  X can
be <code>:def</code> - define this variable at this place and
make it live from this instruction on.
</li>
<li id="497">
<b>:def-arg</b> - like <code>:def</code>, but defining an
unnamed variable which is an argument to a function call.
</li>
<li id="498">
<b>:use</b> - use this variable for the last time in this sequence and
thus make it dead after this instruction.
</li>
<li id="499">
<b>type=:reg | :local</b> - the type of variable being described.
<code>:reg</code> is a register, and <code>:local</code>
is a local on the stack.
</li>
<li id="500">
<b>name=S</b> - if the name S of the variable is available it is
printed here
</li>
<li id="501">
<b>N</b> - a lone integer represents the ordinal of the local.  If
local names are being saved with this function, then the local can be
accessed with <code>(aref (excl:fn_locals func) (1+ N))</code>.
</li>
<li id="502">
<b>regname</b>: only printed for <code>:reg</code> type variable
transitons, shows the name of the register which currently holds this
variable's value.
</li>
</ul>



<hr><h2 id="503"><a name="census-point-2">14.4 Census point description</a></h2>

<p id="504">
A census point is always printed as an object, using the
census-point's <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a>
method. Within the <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> output, the first
character of the line is always "C".  The object is positioned in a
column that generally aligns the pc value with other values in the
 <a href="operators/excl/print-function-meta-info.htm"><b>print-function-meta-info</b></a> output.
</p>
<p id="505">
Fields that are printed are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="506">
<b>pc=x</b>: this is the program counter that the garbage-collector
will see when this census point is in effect. Usually, if the census
point is a call instruction, that pc is actually the saved program
counter after the call instruction.
</li>
<li id="507">
<b>N objects</b>: a new area on the stack is reserved for all
stack-allocated objects; this area is allocated on a last-in-first-out
(LIFO) basis with respect to binding forms entered and exitted.  This
number N states the current number of live objects at this census
point.  The conservative gc will walk up this section of other objects
until it finds a <code>nil</code> as the first object, but
the precise-gc can use this number to determine where to stop.
</li>
<li id="508">
<b>bits=#xHHH</b>: a hexadecimal number HHH represents the pattern of
live local variables.  A 1 bit represents a live value and a 0 bit
represents a dead value.  Locals are numbered 0 through the total
number of stack allocated locals, with the least significant bit of
HHH being local 0.  Thus, <b>bits=#x1a</b> means that local 1, local
3, and local 4 are live and all others are dead.

The Allegro CL <b>gdb</b> interface is a mixture of gdb <b>call</b>

<h2 id="525">
Notes about current frame functions
</h2>

<p id="526">
This interface has a notion of a "current" frame.  When
<b>lisp_zo()</b> (or <b>lisp_zo_aux()</b>) is successful, the frame it
first finds is remembered as the current frame.  Other functions can
operate on the current frame to move up or down in the stack.  Care
must be taken to call
<b>lisp_zo()</b> with a nonzero frame argument after a breakpoint, in
case the running program has removed the stack frames that had been
remembered by the debugger.
</p>
<p id="527">
The arguments are unsigned nats, which are defined formally in the
file <b>misc/lisp.h</b> (in the <b>misc/</b> subdirectory of the
Allegro directory), but which are typically positive integers. The
<b>out</b> argument to the <b>_aux</b> functions should be a pointer
to a C stream suitable for output.
</p>

<h3 id="528">
void lisp_zo(unsigned nat frame, unsigned nat n)
<br>
void lisp_zo_aux(unsigned nat frame, unsigned nat n, FILE * out)
</h3>
<blockquote>

<p id="529">
Print to file descriptor 1 a backtrace from the specified frame, for
<b><i>n</i></b> frames. <b>lisp_zo()</b> prints to
stdout, while <b>lisp_zo_aux()</b> prints to the location specified by
the <i>out</i> argument.
</p>
<p id="530">
Frames are printed in function call or funcall format when possible,
otherwise just the names of the functions are printed as function
objects.  When a frame represents a C function, its saved program
counter is printed in a C form.  If the frame is a "runtime system"
frame (linked in as C/asm, but lisp-savvy) it is annotated as "rs:".
</p>
<p id="531">
If <b><i>frame</i></b> is given as 0, then the current
frame is used to start the output. The current frame is determined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="532">
If no cached frames are currently in effect then the current frame
is the closest lisp frame to the stack frontier (sometimes called
the stack top, even though this value will usually be a smaller
integer than any other stack address).  Whether this frame is the
saved value of the stack-pointer or not depends on whether the
selected thread is currently executing or not, and whether that
thread is executing C code or Lisp code.
</li>

If there is a valid frame cache, then the current frame is the one

addresses.  A call to <b>lisp_cur</b> will display the current frame

change the current frame to the one just arrived at.

If a frame appears to be a lisp frame, but doesn't have a valid function

architectures.

<p id="549">
If non-null, these variables hook into the printing of non-lisp names;
when in the gdb interface a frame is being printed which might be a
C++ name, the <code>lisp_demangle_hook</code> is called, which
should either return a non-null string which has been demangled, or a
NULL (which will result in the frame-printer using the original
string).  After the name is printed, if the original name was
demangled (i.e. the hook returned a non-null string) and if the
<code>lisp_demangle_deallocate_hook</code> is non-null, then
that hook is called in order to deallocate the string which might have
been allocated by the demangle hook.  Users should ensure that these
hooks match in their operation; e.g. deallocation should not occur if
there was never an allocation by the demangling functionality.

unsigned nat lisp_focus(unsigned nat threadspec)
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p id="551">
Set up to focus on the thread specified by threadspec.  After the
function is run any lisp_zo, lisp_cur, lisp_up, or lisp_dn calls
will pertain only to that sepected thread's stack.
</p>
<p id="552">
<b><i>threadspec</i></b> can be one of
</p>
<ul>
<li id="553">
&lt;threadctl address&gt;: if the threadspec is the address of the
thread, it is selected.  All identifications of threads made by the
gdb interface are via threadctl addresses.
</li>
<li id="554">
0: focus is removed and only the current stack is queried from then on.
</li>
<li id="555">
&lt;small int&gt;: any integer smaller than the highest thread index
will serve as an index into acl_thread_control.registry, a
vector of current threads.  Note that the 0th entry in the
registry cannot be selected by this means -
acl_thread_control.registry[0] should be used instead.
</li>
<li id="556">
&lt;stack address&gt;: (SMP and Windows Lisps only) if the value of threadspec
represents an address within a thread, that thread is
selected.  Note that for a virtual-threads Lisp, since the
stack resides in only one place and is swapped in and out
for execution, stack addresses cannot be used to select the
thread.
</li>
<li id="557">
&lt;LispVal thread address&gt;: if the threadspec is the address that
an inspection of the thread in lisp would provide as part of
its <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ob.htm"><b>print-object</b></a>
(e.g. using the :identity option to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-un.htm"><b>print-unreadable-object</b></a>), then the
thread is identified that way.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="558">
Once the thread is selected, the "current" frame (i.e. what will print
if lisp_zo is given a first argument of 0) will be adjusted
appropriately and a message will be shown in stdout which indicates
what stack frame will be current.  From there, <b>lisp_zo</b>,
<b>lisp_cur</b>, <b>lisp_up</b>, and <b>lisp_dn</b> can be used to
navigate frames within the focussed thread.
</p>
<h4 id="559">
Issues:
</h4>
<ol>
<li id="560">
If running in an SMP lisp, care must be taken when focussing on a
thread that is not the current thread, because threads are not
stoppped like they are in the lisp debugger with the :focus
top-level-command, and stack addresses which were valid in one
invocation of <b>lisp_zo</b> may likely not be valid in the next
invocation.
</li>
<li id="561">
For virtual-threaded lisps, there is only one stack, and a
thread-switch operation is performed to offload the current stack to
the saved area for that thread and to then load the saved stack into
the stack area for the thread that will start executing next.  The
thread switch operation is tracked by a counter, and if the number of
thread switches has changed between one invocation of <b>lisp_zo</b>
and the next, the concept of "current" stack frame is reset and the
cache of saved frames is erased.
