<h1>Allegro Prolog</h1>

<h2>Version 1.1.2</h2>
<!--
<p><font size="-2">-[Thu Dec 12 13:33:05 2013 by smh]-</font>
-->

<p>Release 1.1.2 of <b>Allegro Prolog</b> continues a sequence of
minor bugfix and new feature releases.</p>

<p>The prolog module can be loaded with <tt>(require :prolog)</tt>. Symbols are exported
from the <tt>prolog</tt> package. If you intend to use Prolog interactively you will
probably find it convenient to execute <tt>(use-package :prolog)</tt> also.</p>

<p>It happens that both the <tt>prolog</tt> and <tt>cg</tt> packages export a symbol named
<tt>==</tt> which will signal a package conflict if there is an attempt to use both
packages. This will happen, for instance, if you try to use the <tt>prolog</tt> package in
the <tt>cg-user</tt> package without first shadowing one or the other symbol. Usually you
want <tt>==</tt> to refer to <tt>prolog:==</tt>. You will get that if you load the prolog
module and evaluate <code>(shadowing-import '(prolog:==))</code> and then <code>(use-package
:prolog)</code>. </p>

<h3>User Documentation </h3>

<p>This document is not intended as an introduction to programming in Prolog. It assumes
some programming knowledge of both Prolog and Common Lisp. </p>

<p><b>Allegro Prolog</b> is an implementation of Prolog in Common Lisp. It is based on the
implementation developed by Peter Norvig in <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence
Programming</i>. The code has been further optimized and useful extensions provided,
making an industrial-strength Prolog programming environment with a flexible calling
interface in both directions between Common Lisp and Prolog. </p>

<p>Prolog predicates are translated to compiled Common Lisp functions. A single Lisp
function combines all rules for each distinct functor/arity. Special treatment is given
for <i>facts</i>, that is, rules with no variables in the head and no clauses in the body.
The Lisp function automatically captures these as data instead of code. This allows
reasonably large collections of data to be specified as regular Prolog rules. Larger,
highly-scalable data sets can be implemented by extensions outlined below.</p>

<p><b>Allegro Prolog</b> does not intend to be an ISO-compliant Prolog, nor does it
implement the entire Prolog language. Its purpose is to provide Prolog logic programming
as an integrated extension to Common Lisp for use in Lisp programs, not as a separate
language. Many standard Prolog arithmetic, predicate operators, and I/O operators are not
implemented, as they are a subset of the standard Common Lisp operators available using <tt>lisp/2</tt>.
There is also no support for operator syntax (e.g. infix notation), as input notation is
subsumed by sexpr syntax. These choices may be reconsidered in the future if there is
reason to if there is motivation to make <b>Allegro Prolog</b> a self-standing Prolog
implementation. What <i>is</i> provided is the basic Prolog engine for logic programming. </p>

<p>Prolog source files may be loaded either compiled or interpreted, as Prolog predicates
are automatically compiled upon first use. But since <b>Allegro Prolog</b> programs will
typically contain both Lisp and Prolog code intermixed, it is generally a good idea to
compile the files so that the Lisp code is compiled. </p>

<p>All public symbols are exported from the <tt>prolog</tt> package. The definitions
mostly follow Norvig. Lisp S-expression syntax is used rather than Edinburgh syntax,
although support for Edinburgh input may be provided in the future. Prolog variables are
Lisp symbols that have names that begin with the `<tt>?</tt>' character. The anonymous
variable is the symbol `<tt>?</tt>' (that is, `<tt>prolog:?</tt>'). Some symbols exported
from the <tt>prolog</tt> package are <tt>eq</tt> to symbols exported from the <tt>common-lisp</tt>
package, but there is never any ambiguity between use of a Prolog name and a Lisp name.
There is no implementation of the Prolog module system. Programmers should be aware that
there is a danger of collision with inherited symbols. For example, the symbol <tt>cl:list</tt>
is not defined by Prolog but would typically be inherited from the <tt>common-lisp</tt>
package by an application package. An attempt to make a Lisp function definition on <tt>cl:list</tt>
would be prevented by package locking, but definition as a Prolog predicate is not
protected. If multiple application packages attempt to make such definitions, they would
collide on the inherited symbol.</p>

<p><b>Allegro Prolog</b> has no known dependencies on 8-bit vs. 16-bit character images or
on ANSI vs. Modern mode images.</p>

<h3>Built-in Prolog Predicates</h3>

<p>The following Prolog predicates are predefined in <b>Allegro Prolog</b> and generally
implement the standard Prolog functionality. The set of defined predicates may be extended
in the future. A few predicates in this implementation accept varying arity and are
indicated with a <tt>*</tt>, as in <tt>or/*</tt>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <tt><b><p>=/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>==/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>abolish/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>and/*</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>append/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>arg/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>assert/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>asserta/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>assertz/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>atom/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>atomic/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>bagof/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>call/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>consult/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>copy-term/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>erase/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>fail/0</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>first/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>functor/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>ground/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>if/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>if/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>is/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>last/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>leash/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>length/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>listing/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>member/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>memberp/2</b></tt> (<tt><b>member</b></tt>
  without backtracking)&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>not/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>number/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>or/*</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>princ/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>read/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>recorda/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>recordz/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>recorded/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>repeat/0</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>rest/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>retract/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>rev/2</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>setof/3</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>true/0</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <tt><b>var/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt><b>write/1</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><tt><b>!</b></tt> is the Prolog cut. It may written as an atom <tt><b>!</b></tt> as
well as the 1-element list <tt><b>(!)</b></tt>. The Prolog <tt>atom</tt> predicate is
equivalent to Lisp's <tt>symbolp</tt>. The Prolog <tt>atomic</tt> predicate is equivalent
to Lisp's <tt>atom</tt>, true for any object that is not a <tt>cons</tt>. </p>

<h3>The Prolog Top Level</h3>

<p><b>Allegro Prolog</b> does not provide a top level listener loop other than the regular
lisp listener. Prolog computation may be invoked programmatically from Lisp using the <tt>prolog</tt>
macro described below, or interactively by executing the <b>?-</b> macro. Here is a simple
example interactive session using <b>?-</b>. </p>

<pre>
cl-user(2): (require :prolog)
nil
cl-user(3): (use-package :prolog)
t
cl-user(4): (?- (append ?x ?y (1 2 3)))
?x = ()
?y = (1 2 3) <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
?x = (1)
?y = (2 3) <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
?x = (1 2)
?y = (3) <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
?x = (1 2 3)
?y = () <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
No.
cl-user(5): 
</pre>

<p>The <b>?-</b> macro operates similarly to the top-level loop in interactive Prologs. A <b>?-</b>
expression takes zero or more subforms which are clauses and tries to solve them. When a
solution is found, it prints the values of all variables in the expression then reads a
character from <b>*standard-input*</b>. (If there are no variables it prints
&quot;Yes.&quot;). If the character is either <i>newline</i> (usually <i>enter</i> on a
keyboard) or semicolon, Prolog backtracks and attempts to find another solution. If the
character is a period, Prolog prints &quot;No.&quot; and returns. </p>

<h3>Prolog and Dynamic Extent</h3>

<p>Computation in Prolog works by attempting to satisfy a clause and, if successful,
calling a continuation function. If that continuation fails control may return to any
previous choice point, undoing any intervening unifications, and trying a different
solution choice. Prolog unification data and continuation functions always have dynamic
extent. The implementation exploits this by allocating Prolog variables themselves, cons
structure created by unification, and continuation closure functions on the stack, that
is, with dynamic extent. This allows Prolog code to operate with essentially zero consing
and with a resulting improvement in speed.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain functors that typically cons data with indefinite extent.
Solutions collected by the <tt>bagof/3</tt> and <tt>setof/3</tt> predicates are
automatically heap consed, as are any rules stored by the <tt>assert</tt>, <tt>asserta</tt>,
<tt>assertz</tt>, <tt>recorda</tt>, and <tt>recordz</tt> predicate. </p>

<p>The family of <tt>lisp</tt> predicates are special cases. When a call to the <tt>lisp</tt>
predicate is performed, the values of any Prolog variables referenced in the Lisp form are
communicated efficiently to the Lisp code using symbol macros. But those variables may
contain nested unification with other Prolog variables, and the structure created by
unification may have been consed with dynamic extent. This is not normally a concern since
the Lisp code is of course running within the dynamic extent of the surrounding Prolog
code, but it would become an issue if the Lisp code stored the data somewhere with
indefinite extent.</p>

<p>Dynamic extent is only a concern for cons structures. Numeric data is generally not
stack consed. </p>

<p>Some examples will make this clear. Consider the following code: </p>

<pre>(defun ancestors-of (person)
  (let ((ancestors nil))
    (prolog (lisp ?person person)
            (ancestor ?x person)
            (lisp (push ?x ancestors)))
    ancestors))</pre>

<p>If the data returned by the <tt>ancestor</tt> predicate are atoms (e.g. symbols) there
is no problem since they cannot be stack consed. Similarly, there is no problem with
numbers and numeric calculation since the implementation generally does not stack cons
numbers. But suppose Prolog data passed to Lisp code was created by unification: </p>

<pre>(defun grandfather-pairs ()
  (let ((pairs nil))
    (prolog (grandfather ?gramp ?child)
            (lisp (push (?gramp ?child) pairs)))
    pairs))</pre>

<p>are atoms, but it would not work if the objects being passed back were conses created
by Prolog unification. But structure created by Prolog unification has only dynamic extent
-- that is, it may be consed on the stack. Stack-consed data must be copied to the heap if
it is passed outward to Lisp or otherwise preserved outside the dynamic contour where it
is created. As an example see the function <tt>zebra-benchmark</tt> in the zebra example
file. </p>

<p>A top-level list created by <tt>bagof</tt> and <tt>setof</tt> are automatically given
indefinite extent, as is any substructure created by unification and collected on these
lists. Therefore the programmer should not have to worry about dynamic extent when using
these predicates. </p>

<h3>Access to Certain Other Lisp Operators</h3>

<p>There are several Prolog predicates that emulate certain Lisp
operators that can be useful in integrating Lisp and Prolog control
structures.  Most Allegro Prolog programmers won't need these, but
they may be helpful when extending novel tool architectures.</p>

<h3>Tail Call Elimination</h3>

<p>The <b>Allegro Prolog</b> facility for including declarations and
support for declaring tail call elimination were experimental and have
been removed.</p>

<!-- <p>The ISO standard for Prolog apparently does not require tail-call elimination. However, -->
<!-- most implementations provide it to some degree. It is certainly a valuable feature. <b>Allegro -->
<!-- Prolog</b> functors usually do not perform tail-call elimination. The Prolog compiler -->
<!-- tries to stack cons Prolog variables, data structure, and continuations. Stack allocation -->
<!-- of these data enhances performance, but stack-consed data generally prohibits tail-call -->
<!-- elimination.</p> -->

<!-- <p>Since tail-call elimination can be important for particular functors in certain styles -->
<!-- of coding, a crude control over stack consing has been implemented at the level of an -->
<!-- individual functor/arity. This facility is experimental and is likely to change in future -->
<!-- releases.</p> -->

<!-- <p>The first clause of any rule may be a <tt>cl:declare</tt> which makes declarations -->
<!-- about the functor. Declarations may appear in any rule for a given functor/arity -- -->
<!-- declarations in later rules (according to the ordering maintained by <tt>assert</tt> and -->
<!-- friends) override earlier declarations.</p> -->

<!-- <p>The only declarations currently supported are <tt>:tail-calls</tt> and <tt>:no-tail-calls</tt>. -->
<!-- The latter is the default.</p> -->

<!-- <pre>  (<-- (my-member ?item (?item . ?)) (declare :tail-calls)) (<- (my-member ?item (? . ?rest)) (my-member ?item ?rest))</pre> -->

<!-- The <tt>(declare :tail-calls)</tt> could have been included in either -->
<!-- or both of the two rules. -->

<!-- </pre> -->

<!-- <p>The built in <tt>member/2</tt> and <tt>length/2</tt> functors are written in a way that -->
<!-- consumes neither Prolog nor Lisp stack, but if they had not, the version of <tt>my-member</tt> -->
<!-- shown above implements heap-consing by the functor and allows tail recursion on the Lisp -->
<!-- stack. The functor still requires Prolog stack for the unifications performed on the <tt>?rest</tt> -->
<!-- Prolog variable, but this is small (one word per unified variable) compared to the -->
<!-- consumption of Lisp stack that recursion would require.</p> -->

<!-- <p>Tail call elimination is subject to the normal constraints imposed by the Lisp -->
<!-- compiler. These are platform dependent.</p.>The presence in a functor/arity of calls to the <tt>lisp</tt>, -->
<!-- <tt>lispp</tt> or <tt>lisp!</tt> functors will sometimes prevent tail call elimination. -->
<!-- Where possible, use <tt>lisp*</tt>, <tt>lispp*</tt> and <tt>lisp*!</tt> instead. </p> -->

<h3>The Prolog `Database' and Generators.</h3>

<p>In its simplest model, Prolog needs only to remember <i>rules</i>. (A <i>fact</i> is
simply a rule with no trailing clauses and no variables in its head.) All rules for a
particular functor/arity are remembered in the order they were asserted and the Prolog
implementation somehow references these when that functor/arity is invoked. Under this
simple model, there is no firm distinction between that portion of a system which the
programmer considers program, that part which he considers internal data and tables, and
(sometimes) that part which he would consider external data. </p>

<p>But the scaling requirements and operating characteristics of Prolog data sets vary
over enormous ranges. Many standard predicates have only one or two rules: </p>

<pre>
  (&lt;-- (first ?x (?x . ?)))

  (&lt;-- (member ?item (?item . ?)))
  (&lt;-  (member ?item (? . ?rest)) (member ?item ?rest))
</pre>

<p>Predicates like these are naturally represented as compiled code, or may even be inlined.
Rules which are conceptually implemented by compiled program code are managed by the
Prolog assert/abolish mechanism. </p>

<p>Now consider a different example (from Norvig) where a predicate is defined partly by
algorithm (nontrivial rules) and partly by data (facts): </p>

<pre>
  (&lt;-- (likes Kim Robin))
  (&lt;-  (likes Sandy Lee))
  (&lt;-  (likes Sandy Kim))
  (&lt;-  (likes Robin cats))
  (&lt;-  (likes Sandy ?x) (likes ?x cats))
  (&lt;-  (likes Kim ?x) (likes ?x Lee) (likes ?x Kim))
  (&lt;-  (likes ?x ?x))
</pre>

<p>The <tt>likes/2</tt> predicate has seven rules, four of which are facts. Despite the
combination of programmatic rules and facts, this combined data is still small enough to
be represented directly by the code implementing the functor/arity predicate. (This is
true especially for <b>Allegro Prolog</b> since compiled predicates capture facts as
constant data, rather that expanding them into volumous Lisp code.) However, this
representation would become unwieldy if the number of individuals represented in the data
were a few orders of magnitude larger, and especially if more of the individuals had
idiosyncratic affinities. The factual data would better be represented in tabular form,
usually called <i>recorded databases</i> in Prolog. These are managed by predicates such as <tt>recorda</tt>.
Prolog stores recorded facts in an <tt>equal</tt>-key hashtable. </p>

<p>Note that details of the following predicates differ in some ways from those of other
Prolog implementations, and the API may change in the future. The predicates <tt>assert/1</tt>,
<tt>asserta/1</tt>, <tt>assertz/1</tt> and <tt>abolish/2</tt> pertain to the compiled
predicate database. The predicates <tt>recorda/2</tt>, <tt>recordz/2</tt>, <tt>retract/1</tt>,
and <tt>retractall/1</tt> pertain to the hashtable database of facts. The hashtable
database is <i>not</i> automatically referenced by compiled predicates; it is consulted only
by the <tt>recorded/2</tt> predicate. </p>

<p>There is a separate interface to the AllegroCache object database described <a
href="#db">below</a>.</p>

    <pre>
... (assert ((likes ?name Lisp))) ...

    </td>
    <td>All rules for the functor/arity are removed.</td>

<p>A typical Prolog application will reason over sets of data. In small programming
examples, the data is simply included as `facts' that are part of the program source
itself. Reading facts from an external source and <tt>assert</tt>ing them into the program
is not much different. While a clever Prolog implementation can optimize collections of
facts, this approach cannot scale indefinitely. First, it requires the facts be captured
as data belonging to the function. Second, efficient reasoning over large data sets
requires knowledge about how the data will be accessed. Often this is really an indexing
problem, and the application programmer must guide the system by describing (or
implementing) how the data is indexed. It is no coincidence that this concern is similar
to database implementation. </p>

<p>A Prolog functor/arity is compiled automatically the first time it is called. Any
assert or retract to that functor/arity automatically invalidates the compiled function
such that it will be recompiled the next time it is called. While the Allegro compiler is
reasonably fast, performance may be poor if dynamic fact/rule management is performed
using assert and retract with high bandwidth, interspersed with calls to the
functor/arity. In such applications it would be better to use the <tt>recorded</tt>
interface or some other custom fact maintenance code, perhaps using <tt>generator</tt>. </p>

<p>But querying large collections of relational data may require the programmer to inform
the system how the data should be stored and indexed. <b>Allegro Prolog</b> has under
development some general mechanisms for indexing data sets, or else an application
programmer may implement his own custom mechanisms. For example, the application
programmer might back end the Prolog program with a full relational or object database.
These possibilities are under active exploration as extensions.</p>

<h3>The Interface to AllegroCache</h3>

<p>Prolog code can reason directly over data stored in an AllegroCache database. The
interface is contained in the <tt>pcache</tt> module which can be loaded with <tt>(require&nbsp;:pcache)</tt>.
The module is currently distributed as part of the AllegroCache distribution.</p>

<p>The interface consists of the single <tt>prolog:db</tt> predicate. This predicate has
variable arity.</p>

    </td>
    <td>The <tt>db</tt> predicate should only be executed in a dynamic (Lisp) environment in
    which the <tt>*allegrocache*</tt> variable is bound to an open AllegroCache database. The <i>class</i>
    argument must be grounded and have the value of a <tt>persistent-metaclasss</tt> class or
    the name of such a class. <i>?instance</i> is a variable that will be unified with a
    succession of instances of that class. If there are no additional arguments, the clause
    succeeds once for each instance of that class in the database.<p>If there are additional
    arguments, they are pairs of <i>slot-name</i>s and <i>slot-value</i>s. Each <i>slot-name</i>
    must be grounded and be a symbol naming a slot. If ungrounded, the predicate silently fails.
    The value of that slot is unified against the <i>slot-value</i> which may be grounded or
    not.</p>
    <p>If the first slot is indexed and the first value is fully grounded, retrieval uses
    AllegroCache's indexing and is fast. Otherwise retrieval may need to iterate over all
    instances of the class. Improvements in this simple indexing strategy may be explored in
    future releases.</td>

<h3>Known Issues.</h3>

<p><b>Allegro Prolog</b> is a new product and rough edges can be expected while experience
is gained supporting large programs. More attention is needed on smooth integration into
the Allegro program development and debugging environment. These are some other known
issues: </p>

<p>The interface to and capabilities of <tt>leash</tt> deserve extension better to support
debugging. A mechanism such as the Allegro CL <tt>:inside</tt> trace option would be
especially useful, as would the ability to select individually which of a predicate's four
WAM ports to leash. In some cases immediately recursive invocation of a predicate will not
be intercepted by leash. (The issue is essentially the same as tracing lisp self calls.)</p>

<p>It might be worthwhile to make public the Prolog compiler-macro interface if it allows
better optimization of user code. However, the API and conventions for a compiler macro
are complex and need review and some convenience macros before the machinery can be
exported.</p>

<p>A more powerful solution to the tail-jump elimination problem is pending.</p>

<p>Performance could be improved in some kinds of programs by a capability to control
indexing of rule terms. This is available as the <tt>index/1</tt> in some Prolog
implementations.</p>

<p>Definition of Prolog predicate should be integrated into the Allegro CL source file
recording machinery. This would provide warnings about multiple definitions, particularly
in definitions on inherited symbols.</p>

<p>An etags extension for <tt>&lt;-</tt> and <tt>&lt;--</tt> would be helpful.</p>
