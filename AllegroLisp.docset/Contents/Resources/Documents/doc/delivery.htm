<p id="5">
This document describes the application generation utility in
Allegro CL. The facility differs from the image creation utility (see
<a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>) in that the end result is not
a single image file but a directory of files in theory suitable to be
delivered to customers after suitable packaging. The main operator for
creating deliverable application is <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>excl:generate-application</b></a>. It and related
functionality are named by symbols in the <code>:excl</code>
package. They are in the <code>:genapp</code> module (which is
autoloaded if necessary when relevant operators are called)
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="6"><a name="delivery-definitions-1">2.0 Definitions</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li id="7"><strong>Application</strong>: an application is a set of files, including an executable
    image or shared library, and perhaps additional files, some or all of which are needed for
    the application to run successfully.</li>
  <li id="8"><strong>Executable</strong>: an executable is a file that can be executed by the host
    operating system. This file is typically quite small and it is the program seen as
    running when the application is active. The memory usage of the program also depends on
    the <em>image</em> (see below). The executable is also called an <em>.exe</em> (from
    the file extension used in Microsoft Windows).</li>
<li id="9">
<strong>Shared library</strong>: a shared library is an operating
system entity that can be loaded and accessed from within
Lisp. Allegro CL itself is partially implemented in a shared library.
</li>
<li id="10">
<strong>Image</strong>: an image file contains the Lisp heap portion
of the application and necessary parts of Lisp.  Images are created
with <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>
or <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>. Those created
with <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> have
a <em>parent image</em> (the image running when <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> is called). Characteristics of a
parent image are inherited by a child image created
with <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>. See
also <em>original image</em>.
</li>
  <li id="11"><strong>Original image</strong>: an image which was part of the original Allegro CL
    installation.  Any files referenced by the original image must be present when any
    descendent image is run.</li>
  <li id="12"><strong>Parent image</strong>: if an image is created with <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>, the image running when <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> is called is the parent
    image. The child image, that created by <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>,
    inherits characteristics of the parent image.</li>
  <li id="13"><strong>Programmer</strong>: a person who develops the application, perhaps part of a
    team.  This person is also called a developer.</li>
  <li id="14"><strong>User</strong>: a person who uses the application developed by the programmer.</li>
  <li id="15"><strong>VAR</strong>: a value added reseller.  In the context of this document,
    they are the user of Allegro CL (e.g., a <em>programmer</em> as defined above) who creates
    the application delivered to a <em>user</em> (also defined above).</li>
  <li id="16"><strong>Top-level</strong>: the part of the Lisp that receives control when an image is
    loaded by the Lisp executable.  The program that gets control can either be graphical
    (a Windows and X Windows program) or console based.  If console based, it
    interactively receives input from a user and prints information to the user while the
    application is running.  Command-line arguments and input files read by the
    application and output files written by the application are not part of the top-level.</li>
  <li id="17"><strong>Allegro directory</strong>: the directory in which the Lisp executable resides
    and the location where files needed while Allegro CL is running can be found. The <em>sys</em>
    logical pathname host translates to this directory. In some contexts, <em>Allegro
    directory</em> refers to the directory where Allegro CL was installed (since in typical
    practice they are the same directory). The Allegro directory is also sometimes called the <em>Allegro
    CL home directory</em> or <em>home location</em> (names used with earlier releases on
    Unix). In this document, <em>[home location]/foo</em>, <em>[Allegro
    directory]/foo</em> and <em>sys:foo</em> are the same. The name 
    <em>home</em> has
    nothing to do with a user's home directory on Unix.</li>
</ul>

<p id="20">
<a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> and
<a href="operators/excl/generate-executable.htm"><b>generate-executable</b></a> are the
functional entry point for developers to deliver an application.
(Note that <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/generate-executable.htm"><b>generate-executable</b></a> are only available in
Enterprise versions of Allegro CL.)  
</p>
<p id="21">
On Windows when you use the Integrated Development Environment, much
of the file handling and such is done using projects.  When you have a
project defined, you build an application using the IDE menu option
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> (which calls <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> on a project).  In this
document, we describe <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> rather than the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, but what we say about <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> broadly applies
to building applications using projects (thus most of the subsections
of <a href="#creating-deliverable-1">Section 4.0 Creating the deliverable</a> apply). See <a href="cg/ide-ug/ide_user_guide_4.htm">IDE User
Guide, chapter 4: Projects</a> for discussion of projects.
</p>
<p id="22">
On Unix or on Windows without the IDE, the task of <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is to build and assemble
the files for the developer's application into a single
directory. This directory has many purposes. As a developer, you might
want to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="23">Test your application under non-development conditions.</li>
  <li id="24">Test your application on another machine, to shake out 
      any environmental dependencies in
    your application.</li>
  <li id="25">Package your application for delivery to your customers.</li>
</ol>

<p id="26">For the purposes of this document, it does not matter what the
motivation of the developer is, <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is used in the same
way.</p>

<p id="27">There are three distinct delivery types, as: </p>

<ol>
<li id="28">
an <em>.exe</em> (Allegro
CL is in control even though the user might not be able to tell
this),
</li>
<li id="29">
<strong>[MS Windows only]</strong> an OLE in-proc server (the
application is started via OLE calls in another application), and
</li>
<li id="30">
a shared library.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="31">(1) is the most common case, by far. (3) is what is commonly called
<em>Lisp as a subroutine</em>. (2) requires registration, either
implicit or explicit. In the OLE samples there are examples of
both.</p>

<p id="32">
It is important to understand that <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> calls <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> and the latter starts a new
(operating system) process to build the requested image.  Any errors
that occur during the building of the image will be handled in the
other process.  The development environment of the originating process
(the one in which the call to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> was made) cannot be used
to debug the problem in the image creating process.
</p>

<p id="33">
See <a href="building-images.htm#build-debug-1">Debugging an image build problem or failure</a> in
<a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a> for more information on debugging
the image creating process.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="34"><a name="licensing-2">3.2 Legal and licensing issues</a></h2>

<p id="35">
If you want to distribute your applications outside your
organization or inside your organization to users with machines not
licensed to run Allegro CL, you must be licensed to do so by Franz
Inc. One type of license that allows distribution is an Allegro
Runtime license. See <a href="runtime.htm">runtime.htm</a>. Please
contact your Franz Inc. account manager for information on licensing
applications.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="36"><a name="necessary-features-2">3.3 Deciding on necessary features</a></h2>

<p id="37">You need all the features necessary to run your application
(whatever they may be). Certain items, like the debugger, the
inspector, the tracer, will not be present in an image unless
explicitly used or called for. If you are preparing a runtime
delivery, be sure to check the Allegro CL runtime license to see what
modules cannot be included in the image. See 
<a href="#including-modules-2">Section 3.6 Including all desired modules</a> for
information on insuring all needed and licensed functionality is
included in the delivery image.</p>

<p id="38">
<a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> only
builds runtime images (see <a href="runtime.htm">runtime.htm</a>). The value
of the <em>runtime</em> keyword argument to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> (actually, it is a
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> argument
accepted by <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>) must be one of
<code>:standard</code> (the default),
<code>:dynamic</code> or <code>:partners</code>. If
<code>:standard</code>, the compiler cannot be in the final
image. You must either specify <em>include-compiler</em>
&nbsp;<code>nil</code> or
<em>include-compiler</em> &nbsp;<code>t</code> and
<em>discard-compiler</em> &nbsp;<code>t</code>. The
latter choice allows the compiler to be present during the build,
which is sometimes useful. The compiler may be included in a Dynamic
Allegro Runtime image (value of <em>runtime</em>
&nbsp;<code>:dynamic</code>) and in a Partner's Runtime
image (value of <em>runtime</em>
&nbsp;<code>:partners</code>). Partner's Runtime is
described in <a href="runtime.htm#partners-2">Allegro CL
Partner's Runtime</a> in <a href="runtime.htm">runtime.htm</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="39">
External formats and locale where the application is run
</h3>

<p id="40">
Allegro CL supports non-ASCII character sets and allows the
specification of a locale that specifies the standard character set
to be used. If the locale where the application being generated by
<a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is
different from the locale on the machine where the application is
generated, then the necessary code for switching external formats must
be included in the image or available to the application. This is most
easily done by specifying the <i>runtime-bundle</i>
keyword argument true. See <a href="iacl.htm#locales-in-apps-2">Locales in applications</a> in
<a href="iacl.htm">iacl.htm</a>.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="41"><a name="user-interaction-2">3.4 Deciding on top-level (user interaction)</a></h2>

<p id="42">Are your users going to interact with your application through the
Lisp top-level (so they will enter Lisp forms or at least one Lisp
form), through a custom top-level of your own, or will users interact
with your application via some graphical user interface? (Of course,
some applications may have no top-level -- that is, little or no user
interaction is necessary.) </p>

<p id="43">
If your application has a custom top-level, you must write its
functionality and have it initiated when your application image
starts. You do this by having the function that is the value of
<a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>
initiate your top-level. If your application has no top-level, then
the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a> should be the function
that starts your application running. 
</p>

<p id="44">
If you want to use the standard Lisp top-level, leave the value of
<a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>
&nbsp;<code>nil</code>. Any initializations that
are necessary can be done by the function that is the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a>.</p>

<p id="45">
<b>Warning for users calling generate-application from the IDE:</b>
the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> may be a function which
starts the IDE. That value will be inherited if the
<i>restart-init-function</i> keyword argument
to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>
(or <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>) is
unspecified. If the value of
the <code>:restart-app-function</code>
is <code>nil</code> (because you want to use the standard
top level), the value of <code>:restart-init-function</code>
should either be <code>nil</code> or the bname of a
function which will do desired initializations.
</p>

<p id="46">A minimal top-level is provided if you build an image with the
<em>include-tpl</em> argument to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> (or <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, which accepts <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> arguments). See 
<a href="building-images.htm#minimal-top-levels-1">Minimal top
levels</a> in <a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>
for more information.</p>



<hr><h2 id="47"><a name="packaging-2">3.5 Packaging the product</a></h2>

<p id="48">In the past, it was possible to deliver an application as a single
file (called a <em>standalone application</em>). This is no longer
possible. We have, however, created a precise method to help you
easily create and identify all the necessary parts of your application
for it to be complete. <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is the entry point to
creating your application. This function creates a directory
containing all the files making up your application.</p>



<hr><h2 id="49"><a name="including-modules-2">3.6 Including all desired modules</a></h2>

<p id="50">
A standard Allegro CL image on startup does not contain all the system
modules that a program may invoke. Instead, certain modules are left
out (and contained in the bundle file, typically <em>sys:files.bu</em>
but the name varies, or in a <em>fasl</em> file in
<em>sys:;code;</em>, the <i>code/</i> subdirectory of
the Allegro directory). When a module is called for with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a>, it is looked for according to
the <a href="variables/system/s_require-search-list_s.htm"><code>*require-search-list*</code></a>, which usually looks
in <em>sys:;code;</em> and, if it is not there, in the bundle file
(which is essentially a collection of <em>fasl</em> files). Further,
when an important function associated with the facility is called
(e.g. <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/traceunt.htm"><b>trace</b></a> for the trace
module, <a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a> for the foreign
module, etc.), the system detects that the module must be loaded and
loads it automatically (a process called autoloading, see <a href="implementation.htm#autoloading-1">Autoloading</a> in
<a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>).
</p>


<p id="51">
However, the bundle file supplied with the distribution,
<em>files.bu</em> or whatever it is named, generally cannot be
distributed with applications. (It is explicitly forbidden to
distribute the bundle file, usually <em>files.bu</em> but the name
varies, with a runtime image. If you have a VAR license, you may or
may not be allowed to distribute the bundle file, depending on the
terms of the license. In this document, we assume you are not
permitted to distribute the bundle file. If you have any questions
about licensing issues, please contact your Franz Inc. account
manager. If you have an Allegro Runtime license, see
<a href="runtime.htm">runtime.htm</a>)
</p>

<p id="52">
There is, however, a bundle file specifically for a runtime
application. Specify <code>:runtime-bundle t</code> in your call
to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> and
a <em>files.bu</em> will be created and placed in the application
directory. This file may be distributed with your application.
</p>
<p id="53">
If you are creating an application on Windows using the IDE project
system, there is a tool for finding necessary modules. See the
description of the <b>Find Required CG Modules</b> button on the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog-include.htm">Project
Manager Include Tab</a>
</p>

<p id="54">
Or you can ensure that all desired modules are loaded into the image.
The remainder of this section describes how to do that in case you do
not want to use the runtime bundle option.
</p>
<p id="55">
The file <em>sys:develenv.cl</em> contains a list of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a>'s that load optional
functionality for the Lisp development environment. Some of the
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a>'s in this file are
explicitly forbidden by your Allegro CL Runtime or Allegro CL Dynamic
Runtime license agreements, and those are identified by comments. Do
not modify that file but rather copy it or the desired parts of it to
your own file for use with your own application.
</p>

<p id="56">
You should <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a> the modules
you need for your application to work properly. Check the
<i>autoloads.out</i> file generated when the
<i>autoload-warning</i> keyword argument to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is specified
true (the default when <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is called). That will
tell you what modules might be autoloaded in your application and you
can decide whether it is necessary to include the module. (Just
because a module might be autoloaded, that does not mean that it will
be autoloaded in your application.  Modules are typically autoloaded
when an important function associated with the module is called. If
your application does not call a function that triggers an autoload,
the autoload won't occur.)
</p>
<p id="57">
<i>autoloads.out</i> actually identifies the files that
will be autoloaded. A module name is the keyword symbol whose name is
the filename. Thus, the name of the module associated with the file
<i>acldns.fasl</i> is <code>:acldns</code>. The
form <code>(require :acldns)</code> causes the file
<i>acldns.fasl</i> to be loaded.
</p>

<p id="58">
Note that the value of the <i>autoload-warning</i>
argument can be a string naming a file (perhaps including directory
information). If it is, the information will be written to that file
rather than <i>autoloads.out</i>
</p>

<p id="59">If you determine a module which a function might autoload is not
needed in your application, you should consider <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/fmakunbo.htm"><b>fmakunbound</b></a>'ing the function, so calling it
generates an undefined function error rather than a file not found
error (in a runtime application with no bundle file, an error of some

<hr><h2 id="60"><a name="ssl-module-3">3.6.1 Including the SSL module: issues with OpenSSL libraries</a></h2>

<p id="61">
A change made to Allegro CL in June, 2016, which affected all
supported versions, made it link to the latest OpenSSL libraries at
run time rather than linking to a specific OpenSSL library. The way
OpenSSL is linked to is described in <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">The Allegro CL SSL API</a>
in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="62">
The change required some modification to the way delivery images link
to OpenSSL libraries. When a delivery image is created, the names of
linked libraries are stored and they are relinked when the image is
started. Some libraries are identified as system libraries and are
searched for in standard locations on the machine running the delivery
image, others are copied into the delivery directory and included with
the distribution.
</p>
<p id="63">
However, neither of these methods worked with OpenSSL
libraries. OpenSSL libraries change regularly and newer versions
usually have different names from earlier versions. Thus copying the
libraries from the build machine into the delivery directory means
that the application will not see updated OpenSSL libraries. And the
names of the libraries on the build machine may be different from the
names on the delivery machine (or the names of the latest versions of
the libraries). That is why (as described
in <a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">The Allegro CL SSL
API</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>) when the :ssl module
is loaded, the system searches for the latest libraries using a
moderately complex algorithm.
</p>
<p id="64">
This library search method is now done in delivery images. Note (for
licensing reasons) you cannot load the :ssl module into a delivery
image: it must be included when the image is built. It will be if :ssl
is included in the list of files to be loaded (which is the third
required (<i>input-files</i>) argument
to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>). Loading it will link to
the latest libraries on the build machine but those libraries will be
marked so the system will not look for them when the delivery image
starts up. Instead, it will use the same algorithm used whe the :ssl
module is loaded and so will find the latest OpenSSL libraries
available on the delivery machine.
</p>
<p id="65">
You may have to tweak the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_ssl-library-names_s.htm"><code>*ssl-library-names*</code></a> to make it suitable for
the delivery image. The Allegro CL library aclissl.[so/dll] or
aclssl.[so/dll] -- which depends on whether you are creating a 16-bit
cheracter image or 8-bit character image -- must be copied into the
delivery directory but that happens automatically if the
copy-shared-libraries argument to generate-application has its default
value of t.
</p>
<p id="66">
If you want the delivery image to use specific OpenSSL libraries, make
sure you copy those libraries into the delivery directory,
modify <a href="variables/excl/s_ssl-library-names_s.htm"><code>*ssl-library-names*</code></a> to include the library
names (except on Windows and the Mac, where that variable is ignored)
and make sure that the delivery directory is firt in
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Wanted a specific rather than the latest OpenSSL
library is very unusual.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="67"><a name="ssl-lib-version-3">3.6.2 Minimum required version of OpenSSL</a></h2>

<p id="68">
Our :ssl module will only work with specific versions of OpenSSL.

application uses foreign libraries that use OpenSSL, those foreign
libraries must be compatible with a version of OpenSSL compatible with
our :ssl module. Otherwise, our :ssl module cannot be used.

<p id="70">
You must include the <b><code>:disasm</code></b> (disassembly)

the <a href="tpl-commands/zoom.htm"><b>:zoom</b></a> top-level command (or in

In releases prior to 10.0, the runtime license forbade including the

releases). That is now changed and you are permitted to include
<code>:disasm</code>. However, you may find text in the code or
documentation which still incorrectly says a runtime cannot include

<hr><h2 id="72"><a name="init-functionality-2">3.7 Defining the init functionality</a></h2>

<p id="73">
Look at the file <em>sys:;src;aclstart.cl</em> (that is, the file
<i>aclstart.cl</i> in the <i>src/</i> of
the Allegro directory). It is the source for the startup routine used
by Lisp (the function <strong>start-lisp-execution</strong>) along
with the sources for some ancillary functionality. (Note that the
low-level initialization, including mapping of <em>.so/.dll</em> files
built with the image -- systems libraries and others -- has already
been performed when <strong>start-lisp-execution</strong> is called.
As with any UNIX or Windows program, failure to find a needed shared
object or Library file (so/sl/dll) during the low-level startup causes
immediate program failure usually accompanied by a terse message
identifying the unfound file. <a href="operators/ff/list-all-foreign-libraries.htm"><b>list-all-foreign-libraries</b></a> can be
used to identify dependencies on <em>.so</em>, <em>.sl</em> and
<em>.dll</em> files.)
</p>



<p id="74">
Examining the source for <strong>start-lisp-execution</strong> will
tell you the exact sequence of operations -- when the command-line
arguments are processed, when the init files are read, etc., so you
can know in what order to do things. The startup sequence is also
given in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a>.
</p>

<p id="75">
There are several places where a programmer can intervene in the
startup process. One relatively early place is the restart-actions
list (the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-actions_s.htm"><code>*restart-actions*</code></a>). Please note that this list
may be used by Allegro CL or related functionality (such as
CLIM). Therefore, you should add to the list but do not remove items
from it or destroy it. Even earlier, -e command-line arguments are
processed (assuming command-line arguments are not ignored by the
image).  Slightly later (but with a different interface), the
ACL_STARTUP_HOOK environment variable is examined. If it has a value,
that value is read by <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-fro.htm"><b>read-from-string</b></a> and the result is evaluated.
</p>

<p id="76">
The final two locations for programmer intervention in startup are the
functions which are the values of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> and <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>. As you
may see from <i>aclstart.cl</i> (found in the
<i>src/</i> subdirectory of the Allegro directory), if
<a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> is
true, it is assumed to name a function with no
arguments and that function is <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a>'ed. The purpose of
excl:*restart-init-function* is to perform application initializations
of any sort.
</p>

<p id="77">
After <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> completes, either
<a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>
is <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a>'ed (if it is
true) or a standard Lisp listener is started (but
not both). If your application has its own top-level, it should be
started with <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>. (Or if no top-level is
needed, <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a> would perform whatever
your application does.) Note that the function that is the value of
<a href="variables/excl/s_restart-app-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-app-function*</code></a>
must not return. The consequences are undefined if it does return.
</p>

<p id="78">
It is entirely your choice whether you use your own top-level or use
the Lisp top-level. Note too that if you are using the normal top
level, that is the image was built with the include-tpl argument to
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>&nbsp;
true, you can start a Lisp top-level at any time
by evaluating the following form:

<hr><h2 id="80"><a name="initial-package-2">3.8 Specifying the initial value of *package*</a></h2>

<p id="81">Programmers who use a Lisp listener as a top-level often want the
current package (the value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/package.htm"><code>*package*</code></a>) to be something other than the
<code>common-lisp-user</code> package when the user sees the
first prompt. Evaluating the following two forms as part of the
function that is the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> accomplishes this
(replace <code>:my-package</code> with the desired name, of
course):</p>

<p id="85">All logical pathname translations (except the one for <em>sys:</em>

<pre id="86">
(defun start-lisp-execution ()
  ...
  (flush-all-logical-pathname-translations)

</pre>

<p id="87">This is often not what an application developer wants. However, it
is a conscious choice because the potential for mysterious bugs
resulting from bogus translations being present in the image
outweighed the cost of re-establishing the translations when
needed.</p>

<p id="88">If you want to use logical pathname translations in your
application, then you will need to arrange for them to be present. You
can do this in one of two ways: </p>

<ol>
  <li id="89">Have <em>sys:hosts.cl</em> contain translations for additional hosts as required.
    Allegro CL, when it sees a logical host for which no translation is defined, will first
    look in <em>sys:hosts.cl</em> to see if a translation is defined there. This file may have
    to be configured at the customer site (since the directory structure is usually different
    in every system).</li>
  <li id="90">Have another file where the translations are defined. Use <a href="operators/excl/logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames.htm"><b>logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames</b></a>
    prior to creating the image to tell the system about the additional translations file (and
    the system will look at that file in addition to <em>hosts.cl</em> when it encounters an
    unknown logical host). This solution is similar to the one just above but does not require
    modifying <em>hosts.cl</em> which may be inconvenient to modify.</li>

causes all <em>.so</em>/<em>.dll</em>/<em>.sl</em> files loaded during
image creation to be copied to the directory it creates. It also
arranges, upon image restart, for these files to be reloaded from this
directory (which is what will become <em>sys:</em>).</p>


<hr><h2 id="93"><a name="clos-training-2">3.11 CLOS training</a></h2>

<p id="94">
It is possible to significantly speed up the initialization of
CLOS-based applications by gathering information about CLOS usage in
the application and including that information in the application
image. In this section, we discuss what information is useful for this
purpose, how to collect it, and how to include it in an image.
</p>
<p id="95">
First, let us explain the issue. The initial way to create instances
and find effective methods is inherantly slow and inefficient, but
Allegro CL notes what is done and so subsequent similar invocations
are much faster. Lisp will write specialized functions for certain
tasks and will store patterns used for others. Therefore, CLOS
performance speeds up significantly as an application runs. Because it
is only the first specific invocation that is slow, this slowness does
not have a significant effect on overall performace.
</p>
<p id="96">
But there is a problem with delivery images without the compiler (and
delivery images do not contain the compiler unless there are specially
licensed to do so): the discriminator functions that are written while
the delivery application is running cannot be compiled and so run
imterpreted, which means run slowly. Also, it is useful to have any
CLOS optimization information conveyed from the development image to
the delivery image in order that the delivery image will run as fast
as possible from the start.
</p>
<p id="97">
The problem is, however, how to convey this information. The delivery
image is built in a process spawned by the development imge (which
calls <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>). Only numbers and
strings can be passed to the command that initiates the new image but
the information we want to pass (such as compiled function objects)
cannot be encoded in numbers or strings. So we need to have the
development image produce a fasl file which will contain the desired
information and have the delivery image load this file.
</p>
<p id="98">
<b>CLOS training provides a significant performance enhancement in
delivery images</b>. If you notice that your delivery image runs
noticeably slower than your application in the development image, it
may be because you do not have adequate CLOS training.
</p>

<p id="99"><strong>Note about the development environment</strong>: Lisp users
typically run in developer-environment mode. In that mode, the
debugger, the code that runs the Emacs-Lisp interface, Allegro
Composer (if ordered) etc. is loaded into Lisp. Often your application
will not use those facilities and your application images will not
want to include them.  However, CLOS training will include information
about those utilities (and then require you to have them available
when you build your application image) unless you do one of the
following: </p>

<ul>
  <li id="100">Train an image without the development environment. </li>
</ul>

<p id="101">This is the less-desirable solution. You can create an image
without the development environment by specifying </p>

<pre id="102">
:include-devel-env nil
</pre>

<p id="103">in the call to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. You can then train with
that image.</p>

<ul>
  <li id="104">Restrict training to specific packages. </li>
</ul>

<p id="105">This is the better choice. You will see forms like </p>

<pre id="106">
(excl::preload-constructors ([packages])) 
</pre>

<p id="107">and </p>

<pre id="108">
(excl::precache-generic-functions ([packages])) 
</pre>

<p id="109">below. If no packages are listed, the entire system (including
development environment features) will be trained. If packages are
listed, only things in those packages will be trained. Packages are
named by keywords. Typically, packages should include
<code>:user</code>, <code>:lisp</code>, and the packages
of your application. Thus, if your application packages are
<code>:foo</code> and <code>:bar</code>, the
preload-constructors form would be </p>

<pre id="110">
(excl::preload-constructors (:user :lisp :foo :bar)) 
</pre>

<p id="111">The <strong>preload-generic-functions</strong> form would similarly
list the packages. </p>


<hr><h2 id="112"><a name="gfs-3">3.11.1 Generic functions, method combination, and discrimination </a></h2>

<p id="113">A generic function examines its arguments to determine which method
or methods are applicable. This is called discrimination. The
symbol-function of a generic-function is a discriminator
function. There are various kinds of discriminators and the
discriminator for a particular generic function may change during the
execution of a program. </p>

<p id="114">When Lisp determines that a generic function needs a different kind
of discriminator it checks to see if the one it needs has already been
built and, if not, creates one. The creation of a discriminator is
relatively expensive since it involves the Lisp compiler. </p>

<p id="115">When a CLOS application is loaded the generic-functions all have a
simple discriminator which will select the correct discriminator when
the generic function is first called.  Therefore when a CLOS
application starts it will run very slowly unless the discriminators
it needs are already built. The only way to tell which discriminators
your program needs is to run your program for a while and then look at
the list of discriminators that exist.  Allegro CL provides a
mechanism for dumping out these discriminators and then loading them
in with your program so that when the program starts all the
discriminators it will need will already exist. </p>

<p id="116">
You can dump discriminator functions to a fasl file by compiling a
source file that contains the following two lines after loading and
running your application (note that the best optimization is achieved
if you combine this with the caching optimization described below):
</p>

<pre id="117">

<hr><h2 id="118"><a name="effective-methods-3">3.11.2 Effective methods </a></h2>

<p id="119">With method-combination a call to a generic function can result in
a sequence of methods being called. The code that calls the methods
and processes the results of each call is called an effective
method. In order to make effective methods fast, Lisp compiles
them. In order to cut down on the compilation cost, Lisp actually
creates effective-method templates which are functions closed over the
particular methods to be called. </p>

<p id="120">Thus many effective methods can share the same code. Just as in the
case of discriminators above, it is expensive to start a CLOS
application running if the effective methods it will need haven't been
compiled already. And again Allegro CL provides a way of saving the
effective methods that the application has used so that they can be
defined before the application starts. </p>

<p id="121">You can dump effective methods to a fasl file by compiling a source
file that contains the following two lines after loading and running
your application (this is the same as for discriminator functions):

degraded by having to handle cache misses.  Allegro CL provides a way
to fill the caches when an image starts up.

You can dump caches to a fasl file by compiling a source file that

As we describe briefly <a href="#make-instance-3">below</a>, calls to make-instance
can be replaced with calls to some equivalent (but much faster)
constructor functions. Allegro CL provides a way to preload compiled
constructor functions. 
</p>

<p id="129">
You can dump constructors to a <i>fasl</i> file by
compiling a source file that contains the following two lines after

</p>

<pre id="130">

Suppose those two lines are in a file named

<code>(compile-file "myclosopt.cl")</code> to produce
<i>myclosopt.fasl</i>. (You may use any filename, of
course. We use a filename here so we can refer to the
<i>fasl</i> file below.) This file must be loaded into
an image being built after all the relevant <b>make-instance</b> calls
are loaded. This can be guaranteed be loading the constructor file
last.
</p>
<p id="132">
When you are generating an application with <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> and you use this method
to speed up constructor functions, you must include the module
<code>:constructor</code> before the <i>fasl</i>
file that that contains the above call to <b>preload-constructors</b>
(<i>myclosopt.fasl</i> in our example). These files and
modules are typically in the list which is the value of the
<i>input-files</i> argument to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> (the third required
argument). Again, if the <i>fasl</i> file is named
<i>myclosopt.fasl</i>, the value of
<i>input-files</i> should be something like (as the use
of suspension points indicate, we are loading myclosopt.fasl last, as
recommended above):
</p>
<pre id="133">
'(... :constructor ... myclosopt.fasl)

<p id="134">
Of course, you may have some other way of specifying files and modules
(so, for example, the <i>input-files</i> list contains
one file which contains the loads and requires for your

We have already discussed dumping <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> constructor functions.  Note that
calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> where
the value of the <i>class</i> argument is a quoted
constant and each of the keywords is a constant are transformed by the
compiler into calls to constructor functions. A constructor function
is a piece of code that is equivalent to the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> call except that it is
significantly (10 to 100 times) faster.
</p>

<p id="148">
The optimization is automatic when the call to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> is formed in a
particular way.
</p>

<p id="149">
In order for an optimized constructor function to be used certain
restrictions apply:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="150">
The set of keywords must be valid for the call.
</li>
<li id="151">
Only certain methods must be applicable as defined by the following table: 
</li>
</ol>

<p id="152">
<strong>Conditions for creation of constructor functions</strong>: The
calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> are
replaced by calls to the constructor regardless of whether an
optimized constructor can be used. The first time the constructor
function is called, the system tests whether any of the restrictions
apply. If none do, an optimized constructor is generated. When the
restrictions are not obeyed, a non-optimized constructor function is
created. It calls <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a>. Redefining a class or one of its
superclasses or adding/removing a method to one of the generic
functions mentioned above causes the constructor function to be
recomputed.

<p id="154">
As stated above, <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> assembles the files
needed to deliver an application. <b>generate-application</b> both

</p>
<p id="155">
Like many powerful Lisp functions, <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> has many options and can
do many things, but quite a lot can be done with simple calls. For
example, the following call builds an application from
<i>foo.fasl</i> into the directory
<i>myappdir/</i> (relative to the current working
directory of the running Lisp). You could then execute
<i>myappdir/myapp</i> after the above form is evaluated.

<h3 id="158">
Important details of generate-application
</h3>

<p id="159">
<b>generate-application</b> is basically a wrapper around <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. <b>generate-application</b>
sets things up for producing a directory suitable for delivery and
then calls <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>,
which creates the actual deliverable image file. See
<a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a> for information on <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="160">
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>, and
therefore <b>generate-application</b>, create a new image by starting
a new Lisp process and having it load necessary files and then dump a
final image. It is important to understand that the new Lisp process
that does the work does not inherit anything from the Lisp process
that spawns it. The arguments to <b>generate-application</b> and
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> specify
details of the new image to be created, but outside the arguments,
nothing is inherited (although some arguments do default to current
values in the calling image). Thus, for example, if a user-defined
function or package or variable or class is defined in the calling
image, it will not be defined in the new image. Every aspect of the
new image is defined by the arguments to <b>generate-application</b>
and <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> or by
the files loaded during the build process.
</p>

<h3 id="161">The testapp example</h3>
<p id="162">
There is an example showing how to create an application in
<i>examples/testapp/</i>. It is more complex than the
one above, but still relatively simple. See <a href="../examples/testapp/readme.txt">readme.txt</a> in that
directory for information on the example, which is designed to show
how to package an application. The code in the
<i>examples/testapp/</i> directory can be freely used.
(Note that on Windows, you need the GNU <b>make</b> facility to use
the example. The GNU <b>make</b> facility is (at the time of writing)
available for free from <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>.)

A boolean, default

You can also avoid copying locales if you know which specific locales
an application needs. Instead of constructing a copy function for
<b>generate-application</b>, it is simpler to include those locales in
the application. Each locale is small, about 10K, so there is hardly
any space savings in leaving the locales unloaded. Locales are
inlcuded by having a file loaded by the application which contains
top-level forms of the type <code>(find-locale
&lt;locale&gt;)</code> (see <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>). For example, you could have the
file <i>my-locales.cl</i> as one of the files specified

specifying the Version Info for the executable in an application
directory.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="197"><a name="defsystem-2">4.2 Defsystem</a></h2>

<p id="198">
If the application is made up of many source files, then using the
defsystem utility (described in <a href="defsystem.htm">defsystem.htm</a>) will
help the management (for compilation and loading) of the
application. If defsystem is used, then it is easy, for example, to
create a single <em>.fasl</em> file representing the compiled
application. See <a href="defsystem.htm">defsystem.htm</a> and the function
<a href="operators/excl/concatenate-system.htm"><b>concatenate-system</b></a> for more
information.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="199"><a name="tuning-2">4.3 Tuning the application</a></h2>

<p id="200">
The application should be optimized. Allegro CL contains space and
time runtime analyzers that should be used to find places in the application
which can be optimized. See <a href="runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>. The
optimization of Common Lisp source code has two components, aside from
optimizing algorithms used in the application:
</p>

<ul>
<li id="201">
adding declarations, and
</li>
<li id="202">
setting the compiler optimization qualities speed, safety, space, and
debug properly.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="203">
Both of the above can be done globally or locally to a particular
function. Functions which are known to be used frequently should be
optimized by declaring the types of the values bound to symbols, when
the types are known and checked. Then, increasing the speed
compilation quality and decreasing the safety and debug qualities will
allow the compiler to produce smaller and faster code. These issues
are discussed in <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>. Note particularly
the <code>:explain</code> declaration discussed in that document, in
<a href="compiling.htm#decl-help-1">Help with
declarations: the :explain
declaration</a>.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="204"><a name="devel-env-2">4.4 More on the development environment</a></h2>

<p id="205">If the application will not use the development environment of
Allegro CL, then certain features of it can be turned off or compiled
out of the application. For example, you might use the following
global proclamation:</p>

<pre id="206">
(proclaim '(optimize (debug 0)))
</pre>

<p id="207">It will cause the compiler to compile with no consideration for
easy debugging (presumably your users will not debug your
application). Currently, this means local names of variables and the
argument list for functions and macros will not be saved. Although the
saving is not great, if these features are not to be used, then there
is no reason to have the compiler annotate the <em>fasl</em> files
with them.</p>

<p id="208">Another saving can be achieved by evaluating:</p>

<pre id="209">
(setf (<a href="operators/excl/argument-saving.htm"><b>argument-saving</b></a>) nil)
</pre>

<p id="210">This will cause the runtime calling sequence to be more efficient
on some architectures (RS/6000 currently).</p>



<hr><h2 id="211"><a name="gc-parameters-2">4.5 GC parameters and switches</a></h2>

<p id="212">Setting of GC parameters and switches appropriate to
application-specific behavior is important for performance. 
<a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a> contains a complete discussion of the
subject, and the only information included here is a check-list of
items to consider.</p>

<h4 id="213">Switches</h4>

<p id="214"><code>:clip-new</code> (default: <code>nil</code>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="215">If keeping newspace small so that scavenges are short is
  important, then this feature should be enabled. One negative aspect
  of this, however, is that garbage collections will be more frequent
  and this may cause more short-lived objects to be tenured, resulting
  in faster growth of the Allegro CL memory image. You should schedule
  global garbage collections more frequently to keep the image smaller
  if you set :clip-new to t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="216"><code>:print</code> (default: <code>nil</code>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="217">The users of many applications will not want to see the gc
  messages. Keeping this switch <code>nil</code> will
  prevent them from being printed. On the other hand, the gc message
  does explain why your application seems to have paused (during a
  gc). See also the discussion of gc cursors below.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="218">Parameters</h4>

<p id="219"><code>:generation-spread</code> (default: 4)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="220">Depending on the behavior of the application, changing the
  generation spread may cause less garbage to be tenured. The default
  value has been chosen for development but not the runtime
  environment of applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="221"><code>:free-bytes-new-other</code> (default: 131072)<br>
<code>:free-percent-new</code> (default: 25)<br>
<code>:free-bytes-new-pages</code> (default: 131072)<br>
<code>:expansion-free-percent-new</code> (default: 35)<br>
<code>:quantum</code> (default: 32)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="222">These parameters determine the size of newspace after a
  scavenge. There must be at least :free-bytes-new-pages +
  :free-bytes-new-other bytes free, in addition to there being at
  least :free-percent-new percent of newspace free. :quantum specifies
  the number of pages (8k each) for newly created newspaces. The
  initial value is 32 for 256kb newspaces.
  :expansion-free-percent-new specifies the percent free in newly
  created newspaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="223"><code>:expansion-free-percent-old</code> (default: 35)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="224">This specifies how much must be free in an oldspace after it is
  created. A new oldspace is created because there is some amount of
  data that needs to be tenured and there is no current oldspace that
  can hold it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="225">See <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a> for more information on memory layout.</p>



<hr><h2 id="226"><a name="gc-cursors-2">4.6 GC cursors</a></h2>

<p id="227">
A gc cursor facility provides some visual clue to the user that a
garbage collection is taking place. Application writers find gc
cursors useful since their users may think the application has hung
while in fact it is just gc'ing. Unfortunately, implementing a gc
cursor is difficult. See <a href="gc.htm#gc-cursors-1">Gc
cursors</a> in <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a> for more information.
</p>

<p id="228">In addition to the above parameters and switches, the variable
<a href="variables/excl/s_global-gc-behavior_s.htm"><code>*global-gc-behavior*</code></a>
determines whether or not a global gc is automatically performed when
a certain number of bytes have been tenured (moved into
oldspace). <a href="variables/excl/s_tenured-bytes-limit_s.htm"><code>*tenured-bytes-limit*</code></a> specifies this limit. It
is very important to note that an interactive application would have
execution suspended for an indeterminate amount of time if a global gc
is performed--scavenges are normally quite short, in comparison.</p>

<p id="229">
The initial values for the above parameters are reasonable defaults,
but there may be better defaults for individual applications. See
<a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a> for more information.
</p>

</p>



<hr><h2 id="234"><a name="windows-specific-2">4.9 Windows specific information</a></h2>

<p id="235">
The file <em>msvcrt.dll</em> is needed by all Allegro CL applications
generated on Windows. If the <em>copy-shared-libraries</em> argument
is true, <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> copies all needed system
DLL's to a subdirectory of the <em>destination-directory</em> called
<em>system-dlls</em>. When your application is installed, these DLL's
should be copied to the Windows system directory <strong><em>if
necessary</em></strong> (i.e. if they are not already there with the
same or a later version). In the <em>system-dlls</em> subdirectory,
they will not be seen by your application or any other program.
</p>

<p id="236">
These system DLL's have presented a problem for Allegro CL
applications. They are needed if the application is to run
successfully but having them in more than one location where Windows
sees them can create difficulties. Therefore, they cannot be put in
the <em>destination-directory</em>, for that might result in two
copies being visible (one there and one in the Windows system
directory). And they cannot be copied blindly to the Windows system
directory because that might overwrite an existing copy and result in
a version mismatch (since other programs that depend on the
copied-over later version may then fail).
</p>

<p id="237">
We have tried to mitigate this problem by providing
an install wizard (described in section
<a href="#windows-install-2">Section 4.10 Installation of your application on Windows using the Install Wizard</a> below) that does the
right thing: it finds out if the DLL files in the <em>system-dlls</em>
subdirectory are in the Windows system directory already. Any that are
not are copied to the Windows system directory. The versions of the
ones that are present are compared to the versions of the files in
<em>system-dlls</em>. Earlier versions are then updated (more
precisely, are either then updated or things are arranged so they will
be updated when Windows is restarted, so other running programs will
not be affected).
</p>

<p id="238">
Note that DLL's loaded with <strong>load</strong> with
<code>:system-library</code> specified as true (see <a href="loading.htm#using-load-1">Using the load
function</a> in <a href="loading.htm">loading.htm</a>) are not copied
to <em>destination-directory</em> or the <em>system-dlls</em>
subdirectory. The only files that are copied to the
<em>system-dlls</em> subdirectory are <em>mfc42.dll</em> and
<em>msvcrt.dll</em>. (This may seem counter-intuitive, but we feel
free to copy <em>mfc42.dll</em> and <em>msvcrt.dll</em> because
Microsoft explicitly allows it.)<a name="410"></a>

<p id="241">
If your application is started so the console window is created
(i.e. the <code>+c</code> command-line argument -- no console --
was not specified on the command line), the function <a href="operators/excl/console-control.htm"><b>console-control</b></a> provides control over
whether the tray icon and/or the console window is visible, and
whether you can exit the application using the tray icon and the close
button on the console. The method close-console also provides control
over the actions of the close button on the console (and the Alt-F4
key combination and the Exit choice on the tray icon menu).

The value of the <i>icon-file</i> to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, must be a valid Windows icon file
containing the icon that will be used for the application (in place of
the bust of Franz Liszt icon used by Allegro CL). Such files normally
have the <i>.ico</i> file type.  A
<i>.bmp</i> pixmap file or other non-icon image file
will not work as an application icon.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="244"><a name="console-apps-3">4.9.3 Creating a Console APP on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="245">
If you are unfamiliar with console apps, you probably do not want to
create one.
</p>
<p id="246">
Console apps should not use multiprocessing nor <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>excl:run-shell-command</b></a> (in any form, which
means do not use <a href="operators/excl/shell.htm"><b>excl:shell</b></a>

app to hang. The problem has to do with I/O and the Windows console
API and is a current Allegro CL restriction.
</p>
<p id="247">
With that in mind, create a colsole app as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="248">
Build your application (with a call to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> in the usual way. Assume

<hr><h2 id="252"><a name="version-info-3">4.9.4 Setting the VERSIONINFO of the application executable on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="253">
On Windows, the Lisp executable file is name [<i>something</i>].exe,
where <i>something</i> is <i>alisp</i>, <i>mlisp</i>, <i>allegro</i>,
<i>alisp8</i>, or <i>mlisp8</i>. When the application is created, a
copy of the appropriate executable is made and put in the application
directory with the name changed to be the application name.
</p>
<p id="254">
Executables on Windows store information about the application in
VERSIONINFO slots. The function <a href="operators/windows/file-version-info.htm"><b>file-version-info</b></a> returns a list of
alternating keywords and values:
</p>

<pre id="255">

Anything keyword in return value of <a href="operators/windows/file-version-info.htm"><b>file-version-info</b></a> that has a value which is
a cons is a valid value to be used in the list passed as the value of
that argument. The VERSIONINFO in the copy of the executable file
placed in the application directory will have the specified values in
the fields which are specified. Here is an example:
</p>

<pre id="257">

  :include-compiler nil
  :file-version-info '(:company-name "Foo Inc"
                       :product-name "Foo Bar"
                       :legal-copyright "Copyright (C) 2009 Foo, Inc."
                       :product-version "1.0.0.0"))
</pre>

<p id="258">
The executable will work just like any Allegro CL executable: when
passed an appropriate image file as an argument, it will execute that
image file. The VERSIONINFO does not affect the execution of
executables. It does affect information displayed about the
executables as discussed in Windows documentation.

<hr><h2 id="259"><a name="windows-install-2">4.10 Installation of your application on Windows using the Install Wizard</a></h2>

<p id="260">
The Allegro CL <em>Install Wizard</em> is a tool that application
programmers writing Allegro CL-based applications can use to help
deliver applications on the Windows platform. It is designed to deal
with the problem of ensuring that system DLL's supplied with the
application distribution are installed if necessary, but are not
installed if a later version is already present. Note that the Install
Wizard is a bare bones installer and is not meant to compete in the
Windows installer market. We recommend the Install Wizard for only the
simplest of installations. If your needs are anything beyond the bare
bones, please consider using a commercially available installation
program. We list some with which we are familiar next:

</li>
</ul>

<p id="265">
In accordance with your license agreement, you can distribute
Allegro CL-based applications. The files in the directory described in
`<strong>1. Create the initial application directory</strong>' below
are typically suitable for distribution, but again, this is controlled
by your license. Ask your Franz Inc. account manager for information
on what your license allows if you are unsure. We assume in the
remainder of this section those files are licensed for
distribution. 
</p>

<p id="266">
<strong>Reasons for providing the Install Wizard</strong>. You can
create a delivery directory, either with <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> or the IDE's
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a>
menu command. On Windows, this directory includes a
<i>system-dlls/</i> subdirectory. System DLL's needed
for the application, such as <em>mfc42.dll</em> and
<em>msvcrt.dll</em>, are placed in that directory.
</p>
<p id="267">
As described in section
<a href="#windows-specific-2">Section 4.9 Windows specific information</a>, there is a
problem when you install your application on a customer's machine: you
must ensure the right thing is done with the system DLL's. They should
be installed on the customer's machine if necessary but should not be
installed if not necessary. So, it must be determined whether such
installation is necessary. Further, when installing on
Windows, various bookkeeping tasks like updating the registry must be
performed. A program, usually named <em>setup.exe</em>, is typically
provided to perform such tasks. The Install Wizard generates an
appropriate <em>setup.exe</em>. <strong>Note: the user installing the
application must have administrator privileges on Windows
NT and Windows 2000</strong>.
</p>

<p id="268">
Here are the steps for using the Install Wizard. Note that the
Install Wizard will ensure that the user doing the installation has
the administrative privileges necessary to install the application.
</p>

<h4 id="269">1. Create the initial application directory</h4>

<p id="270">Use either <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> or the IDE's
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> to
create a directory, which for example purposes we will call
<em>c:/foo/foo/</em>. This will be a directory of files and
subdirectories. This directory is named by the
<em>destination-directory</em> argument to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> and by the
<em>Distribution directory</em> dialog when using the <strong>Build
Project Distribution</strong> menu command. </p>

<p id="271">When <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>
or <strong>Build Project Distribution</strong> complete, you now have
the initial application directory.</p>

<h4 id="272">2. Run the Install Wizard</h4>

<p id="273">
Run the Install Wizard via a shortcut on the <strong>Start</strong> |
<strong>Programs</strong> | <strong>Allegro CL submenu</strong>. This
will display the Install Build Wizard dialog, which has the following
fields:
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="274"><strong>Company name</strong>: The name of your company (e.g., <em>Foo, Inc.</em>).</li>
  <li id="275"><strong>Application name</strong>: The name of your application (e.g., <em>WinFoo</em>).</li>
  <li id="276"><strong>Version number</strong>: The version number of your application (e.g., <em>1.0.20</em>).</li>
  <li id="277"><strong>Source directory</strong>: The directory containing the output of <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> or <strong>Build
    Project Distribution</strong> (<em>c:\foo\foo\</em> in our example)</li>
  <li id="278"><strong>Output directory</strong>: The name of a <em>non-existent</em> directory. </li>
</ul>

<p id="279">The Install Wizard will create a new directory (called the
<em>Output directory</em>) and copy the files from the source
directory to it. Further, it will generate a program named
<em>setup.exe</em> and put it in the output directory.</p>

<p id="280">The following buttons are on the bottom of the dialog:
<strong>Build</strong>, <strong>Quit</strong> and
<strong>Help</strong>. After filling in the fields, click on the
<strong>Build</strong> button to create the directory specified in
<em>Output directory</em>. <strong>Quit</strong> will exit without
building anything. Clicking on <strong>Help</strong> displays this
section of this document in a browser.</p>

<p id="281">When the Install Wizard completes, the output directory is suitable
for distributing to application users. We assume it is placed on a
CD. How the CD is organized is up to you, the application writer. We
assume the CD contains a single directory <em>distdir/</em> which
contains the contents of the output directory from above. (At the
toplevel, it may have a file causing it to autorun when the CD is
inserted into the drive. In any case, <em>setup.exe</em> must be in
the same location with respect to all other files as it was in the
output directory.) Note, this will work equally well if you are
distributing on floppies or some other media.</p>

<p id="282">Once you have the CD, then you as application developer have
finished creating the distribution.</p>

<h4 id="283">3. On the application user's machine</h4>

<p id="284">The application user (presumably your customer) receives the
application CD and puts it into the CD drive. On the application
user's machine, there is (presumably) no Allegro CL, and the source
and output directories mentioned in <strong>2</strong> above do not
exist either. Recall we assume the CD contains a single directory
<em>distdir/</em> which contains the contents of the output directory
from <strong>2</strong> above. That directory includes the
installation program <em>setup.exe</em>. <strong>To run
<em>setup.exe</em> on Windows NT and 2000, the user must have administrator
privileges</strong>.</p>

<p id="285">When the application user runs <em>setup.exe</em> (in our example,
by inserting the CD into the drive and running
<em>distdir/setup.exe</em>), <em>setup.exe</em> will ask the user for
an installation directory for the application, which we will call
<em>appdir</em>.  This directory must not exist. <em>setup.exe</em>
will create the directory and install the application. Specifically,
<em>setup.exe</em> will do the following: </p>

<ol>
<li id="286">
Create <em>appdir</em> and copy the application specific files to the
<em>appdir</em> on the user's machine.
</li>
<li id="287">
Determine which of the DLL's in the <em>system-dlls/</em> subdirectory
need to be installed. It will either immediately copy any that do need
installation to the Windows `system' directory, or will arrange for
them to be installed upon the next reboot of Windows.
</li>
<li id="288">
Update the registry. This includes adding or updating to <em>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDLLs</em>.
</li>
<li id="289">
Copy the uninstallation program to <em>[appdir]\uninstall\</em>. (See
<a href="#uninstallation-3">Section 4.10.1 Uninstalling an application on Windows</a> for important
information on uninstalling an application.)
</li>
<li id="290">
Adds uninstall entries to the registry key
<em>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\uninstall\</em>. (See
<a href="#uninstallation-3">Section 4.10.1 Uninstalling an application on Windows</a> for important
information on uninstalling an application.)
</li>
<li id="291">
On some Windows versions, if shared DLL's were to be installed which
already existed, then tell the end-user to reboot to complete the
installation. On other Windows versions, this doesn't happen.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="292">
If at any time the installation program gets an error, it will undo
any changes made to the disk containing <em>appdir</em> and to the
Windows registry. That is, if the application does not install, then
<em>appdir</em> will not exist and no application files will be left
on the user's machine, and the registry will be left in the
pre-installation state.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="293"><a name="uninstallation-3">4.10.1 Uninstalling an application on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="294">
Part of the installation process done by the Install Wizard on an
application user machine is the creation of an uninstallation program
and the addition of appropriate entries in the registry having to do
with uninstalling the application. An <i>uninstall/</i>
subdirectory is placed in the application directory. It contains the
programs necessary for uninstallation.
</p>
<p id="295">
<b>Uninstallation of the application must be done using the Add/Remove
Progams control, which can be displayed using the Windows Control
Panel.</b> User should not directly run the programs in the
<i>uninstall/</i> directory.
</p>






<hr><h2 id="296"><a name="testing-delivery-2">4.11 Testing your application</a></h2>

<p id="297">
It is best to test an application on a different machine from the one
it was developed on, as this ensures that machine-specific
dependencies (presence of system libraries, for example) are better
controlled for. However, even testing on the same machine can provide
useful information. Because most necessary files are in the
application directory, even after installation, the machine dependency
problem is reduced. (Note that on Windows, Allegro CL DLL's are installed in
system directories so you must be sure that the application is not
working just because the ones from the Allegro CL installation are
present.)

<hr><hr><h2 id="309"><a name="patching-after-delivery-1">7.0 Updating your application after delivery</a></h2>



<p id="310">
There may be bugs in the version of Allegro CL used to deliver your
application and there may be bugs in your application code. Both need
to be fixed for your users. Allegro CL bugs are typically fixed by
updates supplied by Franz Inc. You, of course, have to decide how to
provide fixes for bugs in your application, but you may wish to mimic
the update system used by Allegro CL. That system and the tools
associated with it are the subject of this section.
</p>

<p id="311">The following two features are useful in an update system: </p>

<ul>
<li id="312">
The update files should be named following a predetermined convention,
so users and the system know what is and what is not an update file.
</li>
<li id="313">
The fact that an update is loaded into an image should be recorded in
the image in some fashion.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="314">
The tools provided support both features. The tools are the <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>defpatch</b></a> macro, the <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a> function, and the
<a href="operators/excl/featurep.htm"><b>featurep</b></a> predicate
function.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="315"><a name="patch-naming-2">7.1 The Allegro CL update naming scheme</a></h2>

<p id="316">
We first describe the Allegro CL update scheme and then discuss how
you can adapt it to your application's needs. Allegro CL update files
are named as follows:
</p>

<pre id="317">
p[m][p][n].[v]
</pre>

<p id="318">So the first letter is <em>p</em>, followed by </p>

<ul>
<li id="319">
[m], one character denoting the version of Allegro CL, followed by
</li>
<li id="320">
[p], one character denoting the product, followed by
</li>
<li id="321">
[n], three characters denoting the patch sequence number, followed by
a period (.), followed by
</li>
<li id="322">
[v], three characters denoting the patch version.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="323">
The version ([m]) changes with each new release. Its value is the
value of <code>excl::*cl-patch-version-char*</code>. For
example, pka001.001 is
the first version of the first patch file on
version k (Allegro
CL 10.0) for product
<em>a</em> (Allegro CL base
Lisp). pka001.002 is
the second version of the first patch
file. pka011.002 is the second
version of the eleventh patch file.

<hr><h2 id="324"><a name="loading-patches-2">7.2 Loading Allegro CL patches</a></h2>

<p id="325">
All Allegro CL patches are placed in one directory,
<em>sys:;update</em>, that is the <em>update</em> subdirectory of the
Allegro directory, where Allegro CL was installed. 
</p>

<p id="326">
Patches are loaded by <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a>.  It takes only keyword

<p id="327">
You should have an <i>update/</i> subdirectory to
your application directory (or wherever <i>sys:</i>
translates to in your application). Then you can distribute
post-loadable Allegro CL patches file to
customers. <em>post-loadable</em> means that the patch can be loaded
into an existing image. However, not all Allegro CL patches are
post-loadable. You must distribute a new image with patches loaded if
you need to deliver a non-post-loadable Allegro CL patch to your
customers.
</p>
<p id="328">
Patches are loaded latest version first and earlier
versions are only loaded if the later version fails for some reason. 
</p>




<hr><h2 id="329"><a name="app-patches-2">7.3 Patches for your application</a></h2>

<p id="330">
The easiest way to provide loadable patches to your own application
is to have a separate directory (say <em>sys:;myapp-update</em>) where
your patches will go. Then mimic the Allegro CL patch naming scheme
and call <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a>,
specifying <em>update-directory</em> to be the directory you
chose. <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a> should
be called when your application starts up. As long as your patch files
are created with <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a>, the scheme should work with
your application. Make sure that the version ([m] parameter) is the
value of <code>excl::*cl-patch-version-char*</code> for the
version of Allegro CL you are using.
</p>


<p id="331">
If you want to use a different naming scheme, you will have to
supply your own <em>patch-file-filter</em> and
<em>patch-file-sorter</em> functions. See the description of <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> for advice on how
to do that.
</p>

<p id="332">
Again, please do not mix your application patch files with Allegro
CL patch files in the same directory (unless you use your own naming
scheme that cannot be confused with the Allegro CL naming scheme, and
even then it is a bad idea). Franz Inc. reserves the right to use any
product code at any time and so you cannot guarantee the uniqueness of
filenames simply by using an apparently unused product code.

  <blockquote>
    <p id="357">The <em>compile-feature</em> keyword argument is designed to
    facilitate producing patches for different platforms. For example,
    suppose a patch is only applicable to versions of Allegro CL that

    will cause compilation to proceed when compiled by a platform that
    uses OS threads but to abort
    when compiled by a non-os-threads Allegro
    CL. Aborting is what you want in that case, since the patch is not
    needed for such platforms. The aborting of compilation will signal
    a condition which looks for a
    <code>sys::abort-patch-compiling</code> restart.  If that restart
    is not present, an error is signaled (and the programmer must
    intervene to do something). More typically, compilation of patch
    files are done in a form like the following:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>

    (dolist (x patch-files)
  (restart-case (compile-file x)
    (sys::abort-patch-compiling (patch)

      (format t "Aborted patch file ~s, featurep returned nil"
              x))))

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p id="359">Compilation of the remaining patch files will continue and all
    relevant patch fasl files will be present when the
    <strong>dolist</strong> form completes.</p>

<hr><h2 id="360"><a name="placing-patch-files-2">7.6 What to do with patch files</a></h2>

<p id="361">
How you and your application team will manage patch files depends
on how you deliver your application and whether or not your customers
can build new images with <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. Only customers of properly
licensed VARs and customers who hold an appropriate license from Franz
Inc. for Allegro CL will be able to build new images. Customers (of
yours) who receive runtime images (and are not independently licensed
by Franz Inc.) cannot make new original images because <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> (called by <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>) does not work in
runtime images.
</p>

<p id="362">
This is an issue because (1) patches which are not post-loadable
(i.e. cannot be loaded into a running Lisp) can only be included in a
new original image; and (2) post-loadable patches can be loaded into a
running image but should not be loaded into an image which already
contains them. Therefore, if you have runtime customers (who cannot
build original images), you can send them post-loadable patches and
arrange for those to be loaded automatically, but you may also send
them new images from time to time (which include non-post-loadable
patches but will usually include all available post-loadable patches
as well). You must ensure that such users do not load the
post-loadable patches in their possession which are already included
in the current image.
</p>

<p id="363">
Here is a possible scheme which will work for applications which
are distributed as runtime images. (This is not the only possible
scheme or even the best for your situation.  It illustrates how the
tools and their features can be used to produce a scheme that works.)
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="364">Your application, <em>myapp</em>, is distributed in a
    directory. That directory contains a subdirectory
    <em>update-myapp/</em> and your users are informed to put patches
    from you in that directory. Patch files are named
    <em>p[m]a[nnn].[vvv]</em>.</li> 
    <li id="365">As part of the
    <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a>, the following
    <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a> forms
    are evaluated: <br>
    <code>(sys:load-patches :update-directory
    "sys:;update-myapp;" :product #\a)</code><br>
    <code>(sys:load-patches);; to load any Allegro CL patches in
    </code><code><em>update/</em></code><br>
    Each time the application is
    started, all patch files named in the <em>update-myapp</em>
    directory will be loaded automatically along with any in
    <em>update</em>.</li> 
    <li id="366">You create a new image for distribution
    to customers. This image includes all myapp patches, as well as
    non-post-loadable patches (which you have been testing internally)
    and perhaps other features and enhancements unrelated to
    patches. In this image, the first <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> form in <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> is
    changed to<br>
    <code>(sys:load-patches :update-directory
    "sys:;update-myapp;" :product #\b)</code></li>
    <li id="367">You distribute the new image to customers, telling them to
    delete all p[m]a[nnn].[vvv] files from
    <em>update-myapp</em> and remarking that patches associated with
    this image will be named p[m]b[nnn].[vvv].</li>
</ol>

<p id="368">Note that even if your customer ignores your instruction to delete
the <em>p[m]a[nnn].[vvv]</em> files from
<em>myapp-update</em>, those (no longer valid) patches will not be
loaded because <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>load-patches</b></a> is looking for product
<em>b</em> and those files have product <em>a</em>.</p>



<hr><h2 id="369"><a name="including-patches-2">7.7 Including application patches in an image at build time</a></h2>

<p id="370">
The discussion under the previous heading concerns distributing
patches to users who cannot themselves build an original image with
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. You,
however, will build original images (and perhaps your customers are
licensed to do so as well). How do you include patch files in the
image when it is built? You put appropriate <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> forms in
<i>custom.cl</i> and make sure all your patches are in
the directories specified in the <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> forms. Allegro CL patches
can be put in the <i>update</i> subdirectory (they will
be included automatically by the image build process). See <a href="building-images.htm#custom-dot-cl-1">Use of
custom.cl</a> in <a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="371"><a name="superseding-patches-2">7.8 Superseding a patch</a></h2>

<p id="372">Say you have sent a patch, <i>p0a001.001</i> to your
users (the first 0 would actually be the value of
<code>excl::*cl-patch-version-char*</code>). The <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a> form at the top of
the patch file is:</p>

<pre id="373">
(sys:defpatch "0a001" 1 "Fixes whatever" :type :myapp)
</pre>

<p id="374">A user complains that including the patch fixes the problem
reported but seems to cause another problem. You check it out and find
that the patch does introduce new problems. So you create a new
version. You put it into a file and compile it to
<i>p0a001.002</i>.  The <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a> form at the head of the file
is:</p>

<pre id="375">
(sys:defpatch "0a001" 2 "Fixes whatever" :type :myapp)
</pre>

<p id="376">
When the user gets the new patch, the patch loader will load it. But
you should also provide a new, withdrawn version of the original patch
file. Then the actual bad patch file no longer exists and cannot
be accidentally loaded.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="377"><a name="withdrawing-patches-2">7.9 Withdrawing a patch</a></h2>

<p id="378">
Bad (for whatever reason -- introduces a new bug or does not do what
it was supposed to or whatever) patch files should be simply
withdrawn. A speed-enhancement patch which actually slows things down
is one example (your idea for a speedup failed and you do not have
other ideas). We recommend replacing the defective patch file with a
new file (same filename and version, so the bad file is overwritten)
marked withdrawn. This shows the fact that the patch is withdrawn in
the <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a> output. So,
the <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a> form in
the replaced <i>p0a001.001</i> would be (like
above):</p>

<pre id="379">
(sys:defpatch "0a001" 1 "Fixes nothing" :type :myapp :withdrawn t)
</pre>


<p id="380">
When the compiler processes this
<a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a> form, it
stops compiling the file. Therefore, you can leave the original patch
source (for later reference) without worrying that the patch fasl file
will be larger than necessary or contain bogus compiled code.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="381"><a name="distributing-patches-2">7.10 Distributing patches</a></h2>

<p id="382">In the era of the World Wide Web, ftp, and users around the world,
a typical way to distribute patches to users is having them download
the patches from an ftp (or www) site directly into the appropriate
directory without actual human contact between you and your users. If
you use this model, you should tell your users to download every
patch, you should use the version mechanisms we
describe above, and you should tell your users to expect files to be
overwritten.</p>

<p id="383">You can also, of course, distribute patches on request, one at a
time, with instructions (which usually include `delete all earlier
versions of this patch!') The more patch distribution has a
human-contact element, the less you have to worry about old version
and bad patches not being deleted. The more the system is automated,
with less handholding, the more being very careful about version numbers
becomes necessary.</p>



<hr><h2 id="384"><a name="loading-patches-2">7.11 Loading patches</a></h2>

<p id="385">Patches are compiled lisp files, and such files can be loaded in a
number of ways.  There is no reason a post-loadable patch file cannot
be loaded with <strong>load</strong>.  Often that is useful for quick
tests. However, Allegro CL provides a patch-loading function carefully
integrated with the patch system described in this section. As far as
possible we recommend that you load with <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a>.</p>

<p id="386">The function <a href="operators/excl/featurep.htm"><b>featurep</b></a> returns true or <code>nil</code> as the features called for in its argument are or
are not on <code>*features*</code>.  It is thus a functional analog of
the #+/#- reader macros. It is used by <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> to process the
<i>feature</i> argument in <a href="operators/system/defpatch.htm"><b>sys:defpatch</b></a> forms. </p>

<p id="387">Things to note </p>

<ul>
  <li id="388">No attempt has been made at this time to allow for co-requisite
    patches. Pre-requisite patches can be created using the
    <em>feature</em> keyword, but the best philosophy, if possible, is
    to always create patches in self-contained files.</li> 
    <li id="389">Loading
    patches with <strong>load</strong>. Patch files 
    are <i>fasl</i>
    files that can be loaded with load and its friends but note the
    following: if something causes the load of a patch to be aborted
    (the required features are not present, the patch is not
    post-loadable, a patch with the same id is already loaded) the
    system looks for a restart named
    <code>sys::abort-patch-loading</code>. If that restart is found,
    it is invoked. If no such restart is found, an error is
    signaled. <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> sets up the restart but
    no such restart will (likely) be present when loading a patch file
    with load.  Therefore, using <strong>load</strong> is best done
    with single or just a few patches but <a href="operators/system/load-patches.htm"><b>sys:load-patches</b></a> should be used for any
    automated procedure or when many patches are involved. Note that
    loading patches marked withdrawn does not signal an
    error.</li> 
    <li id="390">Never lambda-bind <code>*features*</code> while
    loading a patch since the patch file may add a feature to that
    list, but the addition will be lost when the binding is
    undone.</li>
</ul>





<hr><hr><h2 id="391"><a name="ntservice-app-1">8.0 Turning your application into a Windows Service</a></h2>


<p id="392">
On Windows, you can turn your Common Lisp application into a Windows
NT/2000/XP/Server 2003 service with the ntservice package. There is an
example in the <b>examples/ntservice/</b> directory.
</p>
<p id="393">
If you have a Common Lisp application that you would like to start up
automatically when the system starts, and shut down cleanly when the
system is shutting down, then this package is for you.
</p>
<p id="394">
Follow these steps and you'll be on the road to servicedom. 
</p>
<ol>
<li id="395">
<b>First write/test/debug your application without ntservice</b>.
Your application should be working properly as a standalone
application (generated by <a href="operators/excl/generate-executable.htm"><b>generate-executable</b></a> or <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>) before attempting to
involve `ntservice'.
</li>
<li id="396">
<b>Add the following form to your application</b>, so that the
<b>:ntservice</b> module is loaded and available for use:
<pre id="397">
(eval-when (compile eval load) (require :ntservice))
</pre>
</li>
<li id="398">
<b>The main function in your application should call
ntservice:execute-service as soon as possible</b>.  <a href="delivery.htm#execute-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:execute-service</b></a> will be
responsible for executing any initialization functions which your
program may need.  It is also responsible for starting the main loop
of your program.  Please note: <a href="delivery.htm#execute-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:execute-service</b></a> calls
<code>(exit 0 :no-unwind t :quiet t)</code> when the service is
stopped (see <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a>).  If you
need things to happen before <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>exit</b></a> is called, use the
<i>stop</i> keyword argument to <a href="delivery.htm#execute-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:execute-service</b></a> to pass
in a function that can do cleanup.
</li>
<li id="399">
<b>Regenerate your application with the updated code</b>.
</li>
<li id="400">
<b>Call ntservice:create-service to add your program to the list of
Windows services</b>. Usually this would be done by the program that
installs your application.  See <i>examples/ntservice/testapp.cl</i>
for an example of how to add command-line switches to your program to
allow a user to add/remove the service easily. <a href="delivery.htm#create-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:create-service</b></a> is defined
below.
</li>
<li id="401">
<b>Test it</b>!  Your service should now be listed in the Services
control panel applet.  Try starting and stopping your service.  If it
works as planned, you can use the Services control panel applet to
make the service start automatically instead of manually.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="402">
If you want to remove your program from the list of services, you can
use <a href="delivery.htm#delete-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:delete-service</b></a> to delete
the service.
</p>
<p id="403">
The <b>LocalSystem</b> account is very powerful!  Be careful of what
you allow your program to do.  Also note that the <b>LocalSystem</b>
account usually does not have access to network filesystems.  This may
lead to confusion if your service tries to access drive letters that
are mapped to network drives, or if it tries to access remote
filesystems via UNC names (\\host\\share\file).
</p>
<p id="404">
You can use the Services control panel applet to change who the
service runs as.  Note that no account but <b>LocalSystem</b> will be
able to interact with the desktop (i.e., your program's window will be
invisible if you don't run as `LocalSystem').
</p>
<p id="405">
See <i>examples/ntservice/testapp.cl</i> for an example skeleton for a
service application.
</p>
<p id="406">
To start and stop services programatically, you can use the <a href="delivery.htm#start-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:start-service</b></a> and <a href="delivery.htm#stop-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>ntservice:stop-service</b></a> functions.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="407"><a name="ntservice-functions-2">8.1 ntservice functions</a></h2>

<p id="408">
The functions in the <b>ntservice</b> module are as follows. All are
named by symbols in the <b>ntservice</b> package.

<p id="418"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
service-name main </i>&amp;key <i>init stop shutdown</i><i>
</i></p>
<p id="419">
<b><i>service-name</i></b> is a string naming the
service.  This name is the same name that is used when creating the
service (with <a href="delivery.htm#create-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>create-service</b></a>).
<b><i>main</i></b> should be a function (or a symbol
naming a function) which constitutes the main loop of your program.
This function will be called when the service starts running.  No
arguments are passed to this function.  This function should never
return (if it does, Windows will complain that the service terminated
prematurely).
</p>
<p id="420">
The keyword arguments <i>init</i>,
<i>stop</i>, and <i>shutdown</i> are
optional.
</p>
<p id="421">
<b><i>init</i></b> specifies a function (or a symbol
naming a function) that should be executed before the main loop is
executed.  Such a function might load in configuration settings or
verify the system environment.  The <i>init</i> function
should be prepared to accept a single argument.  This argument is the
list of "Start parameters" that have been specified for the service.
This list is usually empty but can be modified using the Services
control panel applet.  If the <i>init</i> function
returns <code>nil</code>, the service will not be started
and an error will be logged and/or reported.  Make sure
<i>init</i> returns non-<code>nil</code>
under normal circumstances.
</p>
<p id="422">
<b><i>stop</i></b> specifies a function (or a symbol
naming a function) that should be executed when the service is to be
stopped.  Such a function might do work that your application needs
done before Lisp exits.  This function should do its job fairly
swiftly, otherwise Windows might complain that the service isn't
stopping properly.  No arguments are passed to this function.
</p>
<p id="423">
<b><i>shutdown</i></b> is like
<i>stop</i> and specifies a function (or a symbol
naming a function) that should be executed when the service is to be
stopped due to the computer being shut down.
</p>
<p id="424">
Please remember that <a href="delivery.htm#execute-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>execute-service</b></a> never returns to its
caller.  It calls <code>(exit 0 :no-unwind t :quiet t)</code> to
exit Lisp (see <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>excl:exit</b></a>).

<p id="429">
<b><i>name</i></b> should be a string that identifies
your service.  The maximum string length is 256 characters. The
service control manager database preserves the case of the characters,
but service name comparisons are always case insensitive.
Forward-slash (/) and back-slash (\) are invalid service name
characters.
</p>
<p id="430">
<b><i>displaystring</i></b> should be a string that
contains the display name to be used by user interface programs to
identify the service. This string has a maximum length of 256
characters. The name is case-preserved in the service control
manager. Display name comparisons are always case-insensitive.
</p>
<p id="431">
<b><i>cmdline</i></b> should be a string that contains
the command line for executing your service program.  The first word
in the string should be the fully-qualified pathname to the
executable.
</p>
<p id="432">
<b><i>start</i></b> can either be
<code>:manual</code> or <code>:auto</code>.  If
<code>:manual</code>, the service must be started and stopped
manually.  If <code>:auto</code>, the service will start
automatically at boot time.
</p>
<p id="433">
If <b><i>interact-with-desktop</i></b> is true (the default),
then the service will be allowed
to interact with the desktop. Note that on Windows Vista,
interaction with the desktop is limited, even with
<i>interact-with-desktop</i> is true. See
<b>http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683502.aspx</b> for
details. If <i>interact-with-desktop</i> is true, then
<i>username</i> (see below) must
be <code>nil</code>.

<b><i>description</i></b>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, must be a string, which (typically)
explains the purpose of the service.

<p id="438">
If <a href="delivery.htm#create-service-op-bookmarkxx"><b>create-service</b></a> is successful, it
returns <code>t</code>.  If it is not successful, it
returns two values: <code>nil</code> and the Windows error
code.  You can use <b>ntserver:winstrerror</b> to convert the code
into a string.
