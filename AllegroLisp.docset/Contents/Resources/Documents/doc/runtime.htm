<p id="5">
<em>Runtime</em> is a way to license the distribution of applications
written in Allegro CL. It is designed to offer VARs using Allegro CL
for product development a way to deliver or deploy their products without
requiring their users to have fully-paid licenses for Allegro CL. VARs
(Value Added Resellers) are users of Allegro CL who develop
applications intended for delivery to their customers.
</p>
<p id="6">
Allegro CL will build, using (on Unix and Windows) the <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> function (called with argument <i>image-only</i> nil) or (on
Windows only) the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command or the <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a> function (called with
<i>exe-only</i> specified <code>nil</code>),
an application directory containing everything necessary to distribute
or deploy to customers. 
</p>
<p id="7">
A <i>runtime application</i> is defined to be such a directory. One of
the files in that directory is a license file (extension
<i>.lic</i>). That license file will permit the
application to start up. If that license file is removed, the
application will not work.
</p>

<p id="8">
As with all Allegro CL features and add-ons, the Allegro CL
installed on your machine includes everything needed to create
runtime applications, but in order to do so, you must have a proper
license in your license file (<i>devel.lic</i> in the
Allegro Directory). If you are not licensed to create runtime
applications, attempts to do so will fail.
</p>
<p id="9">
There are three aspects of runtime applications which will be
discussed in this document:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="10">
What Runtime is, discussed just below and in the subsections
immediately following.
</li>
<li id="11">
How a runtime application is created, which is touched on above and
considered in more detail in
<a href="#creating-runtime-apps-1">Section 2.0 Creating runtime applications</a>.
</li>
<li id="12">
What you can do with a runtime application once you have created one,
discussed in <a href="#runtime-conditions-1">Section 3.0 Conditions on distributing Allegro Runtime created applications</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="13">
There are three flavors of <em>Runtime</em>: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="14">Allegro CL Standard Runtime (described in 
      <a href="#standard-2">Section 1.1 Standard Runtime</a> below) </li>
  <li id="15">Allegro CL Dynamic Runtime (described in 
      <a href="#dynamic-2">Section 1.2 Dynamic Runtime</a> below)</li>
  <li id="16">Allegro CL Partner's Runtime (described in 
      <a href="#partners-2">Section 1.3 Partner's Runtime</a> below)</li>
</ul>



<hr><h2 id="17"><a name="standard-2">1.1 Standard Runtime</a></h2>



<p id="18">
Allegro CL Standard Runtime applications differ from the Allegro CL
Development image in that they necessarily lack certain features and
capabilities (other capabilities may be optionally left out):
</p>

<ul>
<li id="19">
No cross referencer (see <a href="cross-reference.htm">cross-reference.htm</a>).
</li>
<li id="20">
No runtime analyzer (see <a href="runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>) .
</li>
<li id="21">
No stepper (see <a href="debugging.htm#stepper-1">The stepper</a>).
</li>

<li id="22">
No compiler (so <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile.htm"><b>compile</b></a> and

<a href="operators/excl/fasl-read.htm"><b>fasl-read</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/fasl-write.htm"><b>fasl-write</b></a> also do not work as they

commands.
</li>



</ul>


<p id="24">
The disassembler
(the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/disassem.htm"><b>disassemble</b></a> function) is
available in runtime.
</p>


<p id="25">
Allegro Enterprise and Enterprise Platinum licenses include a license
to make standard runtime applications. The Allegro Professional
license does not include a license to make any runtime application.

information on who you may distribute runtime applications to and how
you may deploy them.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="27"><a name="dynamic-2">1.2 Dynamic Runtime</a></h2>



<p id="28">
Allegro CL Dynamic Runtime applications differ from the Allegro CL
Development image in that they necessarily lack certain features and
capabilities (other capabilities may be optionally left out):
</p>

<ul>
<li id="29">

</li>
<li id="31">
No stepper (see <a href="debugging.htm#stepper-1">The stepper</a>).
</li>
</ul>

<p id="32">
Dynamic runtime applications, however, can include the compiler, so
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile.htm"><b>compile</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile-.htm"><b>compile-file</b></a> can be available. (We say <i>can
be</i> because you can choose to leave the compiler out.) They also
allow use of the <a href="tpl-commands/help.htm"><b>:help</b></a>, <a href="tpl-commands/history.htm"><b>:history</b></a>, and <em>redo</em> (see <a href="top-level.htm#command-history-2">Command and expression
history</a> in <a href="top-level.htm">top-level.htm</a>) top-level
commands. (These additional features differentiate dynamic runtime
from <a href="#standard-2">standard runtime</a>.)
</p>

<p id="33">
No Allegro CL license includes (by default) a license to make dynamic
runtime applications. A license to create such applications must
be purchased (<a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account Manager</a> for
information).
</p>

<p id="34">

<hr><h2 id="35"><a name="partners-2">1.3 Partner's Runtime</a></h2>

<p id="36">
Allegro CL Partner's Runtime is a superset of <a href="#dynamic-2">Dynamic Runtime</a>, designed for VARs who
want to give their customers the ability to program in Lisp. That is,
users of a Partner's application will be able to use Allegro CL
including the development environment.
</p>
<p id="37">
Basically, your runtime customers have complete Allegro CL development
images, just like you do. Note, however, that support must go through
you (your customers should not contact Franz Inc. directly for
support).
</p>
<p id="38">
No Allegro CL license includes (by default) a license to make partner's
runtime applications. A license to create such applications must
be purchased (<a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account Manager</a> for

<hr><hr><h2 id="40"><a name="creating-runtime-apps-1">2.0 Creating runtime applications</a></h2>



<p id="41">
Creating runtime applications for distribution or deployment under
your license agreement is done with (on Unix and Windows) <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> (called with <i>image-only</i> nil) or (on Windows
only) the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command or the <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a> function (called with
<i>exe-only</i> specified <code>nil</code>).
</p>

<p id="42">
To use <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>
with <i>image-only</i> nil,
you must supply a value for the <i>runtime</i> keyword
argument, and this value must be one of the keywords
<code>:standard</code>, <code>:dynamic</code>, or
<code>:partners</code>. If a different value 
(including nil) is
specified, the call to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> will fail.
</p>
<p id="43">
The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> builds an application
from the current project. <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a> builds an application
from any loaded project. On the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog-build.htm">Project Manager dialog Build
tab</a>, a control specifies the type of runtime. You should
specify the type desired (the initial value is
<code>:standard</code>).
</p>
<p id="44">
You must be licensed to build a runtime application of the specified
type. If you are not licensed (or if your
<i>devel.lic</i> license file does not include the
correct license), <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account Manager</a> for
assistance (you will have to get a new license file).
</p>
<p id="45">
If you are licensed to create the specified type of runtime
application (and assuming there are no other problems, a directory
containing all files necessary to distribute or deploy your
application will be created. This directory comprises the runtime
application. You must not (it violates your license to do so) copy
files from elsewhere in the Allegro CL directory into the application
directory. Note that it is possible to tell the system to use an
existing directory. The purpose of doing so is to avoid having to
delete directories as attempts to build the application fail. Do not
use a directory that contains files from elsewhere in the Allegro CL
directory.
</p>
<p id="46">
Creation of applications using <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> is described in

<hr><hr><h2 id="54"><a name="runtime-conditions-1">3.0 Conditions on distributing Allegro Runtime created applications</a></h2>

<p id="55">
The license agreement governing the use of Allegro CL restricts your
ability to distribute files associated with Allegro CL and to
distribute or deploy applications created with Allegro CL. The license
agreement is included with the Allegro CL distribution. If you have
any question about what you are licensed to distribute or deploy,
please <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact
your Account Manager</a> for assistance. The license agreement
is the governing document, and if there is any conflict between what
is said in the Allegro CL documentation and the license agreement, you
are bound by the terms in the license agreement.
</p>
<p id="56">
Here are some general principles about distributing files and
distributing or deploying applications (but again, please refer to
your license agreement for specific details):
</p>

<ul>
<li id="57">
Allegro CL will require a devel.lic license file with a Support date
that exceeds the then current date or the Runtime functionality noted
in this section will fail (that is, you will not be able to create a
runtime image).  <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account Manager</a> with
questions about license keys and support requirements for runtime
creation.
</li>
<li id="58">
You may distribute source files you wrote yourself and compiled
versions of such files without restriction. You may include in your
source files any code in the <i>examples/</i> directory
of the Allegro CL directory (but you must copy that code into your own
files) and any sample code found in the Allegro CL documentation.
</li>
<li id="59">
You may not distribute Allegro-CL-supplied files other than those
placed in the runtime application directory by <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, or <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="60">
Runtime applications (created with <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, or the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, or <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>) may be distributed
or deployed only under the terms of the Allegro CL License Agreement
(entitled `FRANZ SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT') and any additions or
supplements to it. <b>Note that being licensed to create a runtime
application does not mean you are licensed to sell or deploy or even
distribute or deploy for free that application without
restriction</b>. Your rights to distribute and deploy applications and
the conditions you must impose on recipients are controlled by the
Allegro CL License Agreement.
<p id="61">
If you are licensed to distribute or deploy a runtime application, you
may only distribute the contents of the directory created by <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, or the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, or <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a> (called with
<i>exe-only</i> specified <code>nil</code>). No other files (except those you wrote yourself
and compiled versions of such files) can be included.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="62">Distributing applications to other licensed Allegro CL users</h3>

<p id="63">
Note that because your source files and compiled versions of those
files can be distributed without restriction, the way to distribute an
application to another licensed Allegro CL customer without worrying
about license agreement restrictions is to distribute your source
files (and/or compiled versions of your source files), along with a
file which creates the application (perhaps with a call to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, or the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, or <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>, or perhaps in some
other fashion).
</p>
<p id="64">
The other licensed Allegro CL user can then use your files to create
the application. This ensures that the recipient is in fact licensed
to use the application (that the necessary add-on products are
available, for example). Just because you believe another user is
properly licensed, you may not distribute a runtime application
(the contents of the directory created by <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, or the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> menu command, or <a href="operators/ide/build-project.htm"><b>build-project</b></a>) except under the
terms of your (not the recipient's) license agreement.
</p>
<p id="65">
Again, if you have any questions about licensing, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for assistance.
