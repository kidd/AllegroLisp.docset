<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>fspec class name position </i> &amp;rest <i>forms</i></p>

<p id="4">
Starting in Allegro CL release 6.0, the new fwrapper facility,
described in <a href="../../fwrappers-and-advice.htm">fwrappers-and-advice.htm</a>, replaces the
advice facility, and continued use of the advice facility is
deprecated.
</p>

<p id="5">None of the arguments are evaluated. This macro advises the
function <i>fspec</i> appropriately with code defined by
the forms. </p>

<p id="6"><i>fspec</i> specifies the function (or macro) to
advise. This argument is normally a symbol but it can be any function
name (see <a href="../../implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>). See
<a href="../../fwrappers-and-advice.htm">fwrappers-and-advice.htm</a> for information on
advising macros. The information in the remainder of this definition
relates to functions only. </p>

<p id="7"><i>class</i> specifies the type of advice. The three
choices are <code>:before</code>, <code>:around</code>, and
<code>:after</code>. <code>:before</code> advice will be evaluated
before the advised function is called; <code>:around</code> advice
will be evaluated around the calling of the advised function (in the
sense that the call to the function will be embedded within the
<code>:around</code> code); <code>:after</code> advice will be
evaluated after the advised function has been called. See below for
more information on classes of advice.</p>

<p id="8"><i>name</i> specifies the name of the advice. Its
value may be <code>nil</code>, but it is convenient to refer to advice by
name. Note that there can be only one piece of advice of each class
with a given name. (But there may be as many as you like without a
name, i.e.  with <code>nil</code> as the specified name.) If more advice is defined
with the same name and class as existing advice, the new advice will
replace the existing advice, thus taking its place. </p>

<p id="9"><i>position</i> specifies the location of advice
relative to other advice of the same class on the same function. The
important point about this argument is that it is used only when the
advice is first defined and is then forgotten. Therefore, the position
is calculated with respect to already existing advice of the same
class, whose positions are 0, 1, 2... regardless of the value of the
<i>position</i> argument when they were defined. See 
<a href="../../fwrappers-and-advice.htm">fwrappers-and-advice.htm</a> for examples that further
explain this point. </p>

<p id="10">There can be many pieces of advice of each class on a
function. <i>position</i> specifies where the piece of
advice currently being defined will go. <i>position</i>
may be a non-negative integer, a name or <code>nil</code>. If it is a number, then the lower the number,
the farther the advice will be from the actual evaluation of the forms
defining the function itself. Thus for <code>:before</code> and
<code>:around</code> advice, advice 0 will be run first, then 1,
2, 3, and so on, while for <code>:after</code> advice, advice 0
will be run last, preceded by 1, 2, 3, and so on. Say there are n
pieces of advice of the class of the advice being defined. The
existing advice is numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., <code>n-</code>1,
inclusive. Then a position of 0 will result in the new advice being
placed farther from the function call than all the rest of the advice,
a position of <code>k</code> where <code>k</code> is
between 1 and <code>n-1</code> will be placed farther then the
<code>k</code>th piece of existing advice, and a position
<code>n</code> or larger will be placed nearest the function
call.
</p>

<p id="11">
If <i>position</i> is <code>nil</code>, the
advice is put farther from the function call then all
currently-defined advice of the same class. If position is a name of
existing advice, the advice will be placed next farther from the
function call (before for <code>:before</code> and
<code>:around</code>, after for <code>:after</code>) than
the named advice. Note that if new advice has the same name and class
as existing advice, it will replace the existing advice and take the
position of the existing advice. In that case, the position argument
will be ignored.
</p>

<p id="12">
<i>forms</i> are the actual forms that will be
evaluated. All advice on a function is combined in an enclosing
<b>cl:prog</b>, so a return placed anywhere in any type of advice will
cause the advised function to return with the values specified with
the return, without any further advice code being evaluated and (if it
has not already done so) without the advised function being
evaluated. Syntactically, <code>:around</code> advice should be
a single form. If multiple forms are specified, however, they are
automatically wrapped in a <b>cl:progn</b>.  <b>Warning</b>:
<i>forms</i> cannot be the single form <code>nil</code>. If you want the single form <code>nil</code> (in, for example, :around advice to not call the
function and return <code>nil</code>), specify
<code>(progn nil)</code> instead.
</p>

<h2 id="13">Advice of class :before </h2>

<p id="14"><code>:before</code> advice will be evaluated before the function
call. The argument list with which the function was called is
available to <code>:before</code> advice. The argument list is stored
as the value of the variable <code>excl:arglist</code> (this symbol
also names a function which returns the arguments list of an
operator). You may check the values in this list, change the values or
replace the list altogether with a new list. (If you replace the list,
be careful that it have the correct format for the function -- number
and types of arguments in the list -- or you may get an error, or
worse, a wrong result but no error.) <code>:before</code> advice is
used only for its side effects. Any value returned by
<code>:before</code> advice code is ignored. </p>

<h2 id="15">Advice of class :around</h2>

<p id="16">
<code>:around</code> advice places the function call inside the
code of the advice. The keyword <code>:do-it</code> signals where the
function should be called within the advice code. When Lisp encounters
the <code>:do-it</code>, it calls the next piece of
<code>:around</code> advice, if there is more, or the function. When
the function returns, the <code>:around</code> advice code continues
execution. <code>:do-it</code> may appear several times in
<code>:around</code> advice. Normally, it is placed in conditional
code, as shown in this code fragment:
</p>

<pre id="17">
(advise myfunction :around example nil
  (... [do stuff before function call in :around advice code]
   (if (zerop (car excl:arglist)) (+ 5 :do-it) (* 7 :do-it))
   ... [do stuff after function call] ))
</pre>

<p id="18">
In that case, the system will encounter one or the other
<code>:do-it</code>, but not both. However, it is allowed to
have several <code>:do-it</code>s all of which are evaluated. In
that case, the succeeding <code>:around</code> advice and the
advised function are evaluated more than
once. <code>:after</code> advice is still evaluated only once,
however. <code>:around</code> advice can work with
<code>excl:arglist</code> before the
<code>:do-it</code>. Since the advised function is run at the
location specified by the <code>:do-it</code>, the values the
function return are available to <code>:around</code> advice
just like with any function call. The list bound to the variable
<code>values</code> is not set up until after all
<code>:around</code> advice is run, then
<code>values</code> is bound to the list of values returned by
the final piece of <code>:around</code> advice.  Note that if
the function returns multiple values, these should be caught with
<a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/multiple.htm"><b>multiple-value-bind</b></a> or <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/multipl1.htm"><b>multiple-value-list</b></a> or some similar
function if you are interested in the values beyond the first.
</p>

<h2 id="19">Advice of class :after</h2>

<p id="20">advice is evaluated after the function has completed, but before
control is passed back to whatever called the
function. <code>:after</code> advice may examine and change the list
of returned values from the last piece of <code>:around</code> advice
(or the function, if there is no <code>:around</code> advice) stored
in the variable <code>values</code>.  <code>:after</code> advice is
used only for its side effects. Any value returned by the
<code>:after</code> advice code is ignored. The list bound to
<code>values</code> is returned from the now completed function
call. </p>
