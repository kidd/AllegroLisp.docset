<h3><a name="sec-1-1"></a>1.1 Version and History</h3>

<p>Allegro CL 10.0 for the most part provides a unified Windows/Unix
implementation. The important difference between the Windows and the
Unix implementations is that the Windows implementation is closely
integrated with the Windows operating system, and provides
(particularly with the Integrated Development Environment described in
this document) tools for producing Windows-style applications, which
can be also used on certain Linux platfoms and on the Mac.
</p>

<p>The Integrated Development Environment is a windowized tool for developing user
interfaces to applications. Common Graphics is the window system used by the IDE. Most
symbols associated with the IDE and Common Graphics are in the <code>cg</code> package.</p>

<h4>
A note on illustrations
</h4>
<p>
The icon for Allegro CL changed in release 8.2. It was a blue bust (of
Franz Liszt) and now has natural colors. The icon appears at the upper
left of most IDE windows. Some illustrations in this manual are from
earlier releases and so show the old icon. Others have been
updated. When only unimportant details of the contents of the
illustration, such as the icon, changed in release 8.2, we have not in
many cases replaced the illustration.
</p>

<h3><a name="sec-1-2"></a>1.2 Documentation</h3>

<p>Allegro CL 10.0, Common Graphics, and the IDE are documented with HTML files integrated
with the rest of the Allegro CL documentation. The documentation includes (<i>&lt;Allegro
directory&gt;</i> is the directory where Allegro CL is installed): 

<ul>
  <li><i>The Allegro CL Integrated Development Environment User Guide</i>. This is the
    document you are now reading. It describes the tools for developing the user interface to
    an application. </li>
  <li><i>The Allegro CL Documentation</i>. All Allegro CL documentation, including that for
    Common Graphics and the IDE, is online, in a collection of HTML files (except for certain
    add-on products documented in PDF files). The base directory for the Allegro CL online
    documentation is <i>&lt;Allegro directory&gt;/doc/</i>. The file <i>introduction.htm</i>
    in that directory provides a guide to the Allegro CL documentation. Clicking the menu
    command <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/help-menu.htm#acl-doc">Help | Allegro CL
    Documentation</a> displays <a href="../../introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>. The file
    <a href="../../cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a> provides information about Common Graphics and the
    Integrated Development Environment, including information about CG and IDE documentation.</li>
  <li><b>The Release Notes</b>. <a href="../../release-notes.htm">release-notes.htm</a>.
    Included are the release notes for Common Graphics and the IDE.</li>
  <li><strong>The Installation Guide</strong>. <a href="../../installation.htm">installation.htm</a></li>
  <li>The ANSI Common Lisp specification. (The starting page of that document is in <i>&lt;Allegro
    directory&gt;/ansicl/ansicl.htm</i>.) This provides the primary documentation for Common
    Lisp functionality. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extensions and implementation details of standard Common Lisp functionality are
  described in various Allegro CL documents, particularly <a href="../../implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>.
  The index in <a href="../../index.htm">index.htm</a> has links to this documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Doodler tutorial. This is a completely worked out example of using the IDE to build an
    application (which draws curves based on user specifications). The project is described
    and the steps of the tutorial are detailed in <i>&lt;Allegro
    directory&gt;/gui-builder-tutorial/doodler.htm</i>.</li>
  <li>Examples. There are many examples of using Common Graphics. See the Examples tab of the <a
    href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator dialog</a>, displayed by
    <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/help-menu.htm#examples">Help | Common Graphics

<h3><a name="sec-1-3"></a>1.3 Editor</h3>

<p>You can run the Allegro CL 10.0 IDE as a subprocess of GNU Emacs. Just start Allegro CL
within Emacs in the usual way. Make sure you specify <i>allegro.dxl</i> as the image file
(rather than <i>mlisp.dxl</i>, which is Allegro CL without the IDE). </p>

<p>Files will be opened in Emacs (rather than the IDE Editor Workbook) if the <b>Open
Files in GNU Emacs</b> option on the Editor Options pane is selected and Emacs is running
and linked to Lisp. (The illustration just below shows the Editor Options pane with the <b>Open
Files in GNU Emacs</b> option not checked.)</p>

<p>Editing (other than using Emacs) should be in text-edit windows or panes, such as the
Debug window and the Editor Workbook (which has tabs for different editor buffers). The
editing mode for text-edit windows can be Host, Emacs, or Brief. The mode is set in the <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog-editor.htm">Editor</a> tab of the <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog.htm">Options</a> dialog (displayed with <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#options">Tools | Options</a>). Here is
that dialog. The Host mode is chosen:</p>

<p><img src="../../pictures/options-ed.jpg" width="566" height="425"></p>

<p>The :EMACS mode uses a subset of standard Emacs keybindings. Note that these may alter
menu shortcuts, to prevent them from conflicting with the Emacs keybindings.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-1-4"></a>1.4 Case mode and International Characters</h3>

<p>Allegro CL is available in <i>modern mode</i> (case-sensitive, lowercase preferred) and
<i>ANSI mode</i> (case-insensitive, uppercase preferred). Images with different modes are
supplied with the Allegro CL distribution (except the Trial distribution which has only
ANSI mode, through you can build a modern mode image). You may run Allegro CL with the IDE
in either modern mode or ANSI mode (there are separate Start menu items for each mode).</p>

<p>Allegro CL 10.0 also supports international characters, meaning that characters are
16-bits wide rather than 8-bits wide. (8-bit versions of Allegro CL 10.0 are supplied. No
pre-built 8-bit IDE image is supplied, though such can be built.) You should not see any
difference because you are using an international version. Please contact Franz Inc. for
assistance if you run into problems. International character support is described in <a
href="../../iacl.htm">doc/iacl.htm</a> (<i>iacl</i> for <i>I</i>nternational <i>A</i>llegro
<i>CL</i>).</p>

<h3><a name="sec-1-5"></a>1.5 The IDE and CG modules and packages</h3>

<p>The modules for the IDE and for Common Graphics are separate (the separation occurred
in release 8.2). The IDE is not needed in applications. The separation of CG and the IDE
allows the IDE to easily be left out of an application. Symbols naming functionality in
the IDE are in the <strong>ide</strong> package.</p>

<p>The <strong>cg</strong> package has been divided into several dozen subsidiary
packages. All documented symbols in the subsidiary packages are also exported from the <strong>cg</strong>
package. Programmers therefore do not need to deal with the subsidiary packages
specifically. Programmers will see the packages listed in the <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/package-list-dialog.htm">Package List</a> window and
when a symbol is described (using <strong>describe</strong> or the standard keyboard
equivalent Control-Shift-D), but in general the subsidiary packages can be ignored.</p>

<p>The subsidiary packages are associated with individual modules. This division into
subsidiary packages and modules also allows applications to load only the functionality
needed for the application.</p>

<h3><a name="sec-1-6"></a>1.6 Configuration</h3>

<p>Your preferences about window arrangement, choice of fonts, editor
mode, and so on are stored in a file
called <i>allegro-ide-options.cl</i>. This file is placed in your home
directory (on UNIX) or your personal documents directory (on
Windows). Under some option choices, the file is placed in the Allegro
directory (where Allegro CL was installed).  This file is updated when
you exit Allegro CL (unless the menu
command <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#save-options-on-exit">Tools
| Save Options on Exit</a> is toggled off), incorporating changes made
using
the <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog.htm">Options</a>
dialog (displayed
with <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#options">Tools
| Options</a>) and when you make direct changes to the configuration
using the Inspector as described just below.  Deleting or
renaming <i>allegro-ide-options.cl</i> (and
deleting <i>allegro-ide-options.fasl</i> if it exists) will cause the
IDE to revert to the initial default settings.</p>

<p>Most details of the system are stored as the value of the variable <a
href="../../variables/ide/s_ide-system_s.htm">*ide-system*</a> (some relating specifically
to the windowing system rather than the user interface are stored in the variable <a
href="../../variables/cg/s_system_s.htm">*system*</a>). </p>

<p>You can examine the configuration by clicking <a
href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#inspect-system-data">Tools | Inspect
System Data | [CG or IDE] Configuration Options</a> (there are two menu items, one for CG
options and one for IDE options). The Inspector shows all configuration properties and
their values. Values can be changed directly in the Inspector, by clicking on the value
and typing or clicking on the extended editor button to the right of the value and
entering the new value in the dialog that appears (different dialogs appear for different
types of values). Here is the Inspector showing some configuration options:</p>

<h3><a name="sec-1-7"></a>1.7 Reporting bugs and asking questions</h3>

<p>Send problem reports and technical questions of any type by email to support@franz.com.
See our website (<a href="http://www.franz.com">www.franz.com</a>) for information on
Franz Inc.'s mailing address and telephone number.</p>

<p>
Please state explicitly in your message that you have Allegro CL 10.0
with the IDE and say what version of Windows you are using (2000, NT,
XP, 7, etc.), or the OS version for Linux or the Mac. Send us the
output
of <a href="../../operators/excl/print-system-state.htm">print-system-state</a>
(the output includes information about patches and settings and other
information which can be very helpful in determining the cause of a
problem). You can
use <a href="../../operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm">dribble-bug</a> to
write a file showing a transcript of a failure (the file will
automatically
contain <a href="../../operators/excl/print-system-state.htm">print-system-state</a>
output). You can produce an automatic dribble along with a backtrace
by doing <a href="../../ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#save">File
| Save</a> while a backtrace pane is selected (the backtrace pane is
displayed when you click on the <b>Debug</b> button of
a <b>Restarts</b> dialog after an error). The saved file is suitable
for including in a bug report. See the
topic <a href="../../cgide.htm#bug-reports-1">About submitting a bug
report from a break in the IDE</a> in
the <a href="../../cgide.htm">doc/cgide.htm</a> file. See
also <a href="../../introduction.htm#reporting-bugs-1">Reporting
bugs</a> in <a href="../../introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>.
