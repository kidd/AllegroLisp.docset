The clipboard is a facility that allows the user to interactively copy
or move text or other data from one application to another, or from
one window to another within an application.  This is typically done
via the common "cut", "copy", and "paste" commands.  Common Graphics
provides a general programmatic interface to the clipboard that allows
applications to implement arbitrary gestures to cut, copy, and paste
arbitrary data objects or to otherwise manipulate data on the
clipboard.
</p><hr><hr><h2 id="5"><a name="two-clipboards-1">1.0 The two clipboards in Common Graphics</a></h2>

<p id="6">
There are actually two clipboards in Common Graphics. The first is the
<em>operating system clipboard</em> or <em>OS clipboard</em>, and the
second is the <em>lisp clipboard</em>. The OS clipboard is the one
implemented within the operating system, and behaves as it does in
many applications. The lisp clipboard adds additional functionality on
top of the OS clipboard. Some Common Graphics functions act directly
on the OS clipboard, and may be used if the additional lisp clipboard
functionality is not needed, while other Common Graphics functions act
on the lisp clipboard (and thereby indirectly on the OS clipboard as
well). The IDE's cut, copy, and paste commands always use the lisp
clipboard.
</p>
<p id="7">
The OS clipboard allows copying data from one application to another,
but allows copying only certain standard types of data, such as text,
rich text, and pixmaps. The lisp clipboard allows copying any type of
data, but this works only among the windows of a single lisp
application. In the IDE, if you do a paste into the inspector, for
example, the inspector knows to insert the actual lisp object that's
on the top of the lisp clipboard into the currently selected slot.
Custom pasting such as this is accomplished by defining a <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a> method or
a <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a>
method (discussed later) for the window.
</p>
<p id="8">
The OS clipboard holds only one data object at any time (or perhaps up
to one object of each standard type). The lisp clipboard can hold a
stack of data items, and items can be pushed onto or popped off of the
stack.
</p>
<p id="9">
The two clipboards are kept in sync as long as the lisp clipboard
functions are used rather than the OS clipboard functions. This means
that the top object on the lisp clipboard is always the same as the
single object on the OS clipboard. Popping the top object off of the
lisp clipboard, for example, will leave a different object not only on
the top of the lisp clipboard but also on the OS clipboard. Also,
when a value is copied to the OS clipboard in another application, it
is placed on the lisp clipboard stack.
</p>
<p id="10">
If the top lisp clipboard object is not of one of the data types that
are defined for the OS clipboard, then the OS clipboard value will be
a string representation of the object, while the lisp clipboard will
hold the object itself. Therefore, pasting into another application
will paste a string, while pasting into a window within the lisp
application may potentially paste the object itself, if the window
knows how to handle that sort of object.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="11"><a name="os-clipboard-1">2.0 The OS clipboard</a></h2>

<p id="12">
The OS clipboard value for any of the defined data types may be
retrieved by calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a>, or set by calling
<a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>(setf clipboard-object)</b></a>. For example,
<code>(clipboard-object :text)</code> returns the plain-text
value which is currently on the OS clipboard if any, and otherwise
returns nil. <code>(setf (clipboard-object :text) "foo")</code>
would place the string "foo" onto the OS clipboard, from where another
application could paste the string.
</p>
<p id="13">
<a href="../operators/cg/a/available-clipboard-formats.htm"><b>available-clipboard-formats</b></a> returns
a list of symbols indicating which standard OS clipboard data formats
are both implemented in CG and happen to be present at the moment on
the OS clipboard. This tells an application which data types it could
retrieve from the OS clipboard at that time. Currently CG implements
the :text, :rich-text, and :pixmap data formats.
</p>
<p id="14">
For example, if <code>(available-clipboard-formats)</code>
returns the list <code>(:pixmap)</code>, this indicates that the
only thing currently on the OS clipboard that CG knows how to retrieve
is a pixmap. An application could then either do nothing because it
doesn't care about pixmaps, or it could call <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a>, passing :pixmap as
the <i>clipboard-format</i> argument, to create and
return a Common Graphics pixmap from the OS clipboard value. Then it
could use that pixmap however it wishes, such as by "pasting" it into
a window by calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-to-stream.htm"><b>copy-to-stream</b></a> to draw the pixmap
in a window.
</p>
<p id="15">
Most applications first clear all values from the OS clipboard when a
copy is done, so that only the newly copied object remains on the OS
clipboard.  A common exception is that when rich text is copied, it is
often available as the :rich-text object on the OS clipboard while the
plain text version of it is simultaneously available as the :text
object.  A Common Graphics application could then take whichever
format it is interested in by passing the appropriate
<i>clipboard-format</i> argument to <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a>. When calling
<a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>(setf clipboard-object)</b></a>, the
clipboard is first cleared unless the
<i>empty-clipboard</i> keyword argument is passed as
nil.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="16"><a name="lisp-clipboard-1">3.0 The lisp clipboard</a></h2>

<p id="17">
The functions discussed in this section manipulate the lisp clipboard,
and because the lisp clipboard is built on top of the OS clipboard,
they manipulate the OS clipboard as well.
</p>
<p id="18">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/p/push-lisp-clipboard.htm"><b>push-lisp-clipboard</b></a> adds a new
value to the top of the lisp clipboard stack and sets the OS clipboard
value; this corresponds to calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>(setf
clipboard-object)</b></a> to modify the OS clipboard only. The
<a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-history-limit.htm"><b>clipboard-history-limit</b></a>
configuration option prevents the lisp clipboard stack from
becoming overly long. The function <a href="../operators/cg/p/pop-lisp-clipboard.htm"><b>pop-lisp-clipboard</b></a> removes the top
object from the lisp clipboard stack and returns it, placing the
object that remains at the top of the lisp clipboard stack onto the OS
clipboard; this corresponds to calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-object.htm"><b>clipboard-object</b></a> to retrieve the OS
clipboard value directly without modifying the OS clipboard.
</p>
<p id="19">
If an application would like to be notified whenever the lisp
clipboard changes, it can add a <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipboard-changed.htm"><b>clipboard-changed</b></a> method.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="20"><a name="cut-copy-paste-1">4.0 Built-In Cut, Copy, and Paste functionality</a></h2>

<p id="21">
You can use the functions above to manipulate clipboard values however
you like. But if you are implementing typical cut/copy/paste behavior,
you may be able to do so with less code by using the built-in
overridable generic functions that Common Graphics supplies for this.
The functions <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-command.htm"><b>cut-command</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> all manipulate the
lisp clipboard (and therefore the OS clipboard as well). The default
methods also call the corresponding functions <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-selection.htm"><b>cut-selection</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a>, which
are responsible for actually retrieving the value from the window that
is to be placed onto the clipboard, or inserting the value being
pasted into the window in some way.
</p>
<p id="22">
(An exception is that the <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-selection.htm"><b>cut-selection</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a> methods for
rich-edit-pane do push the value onto the clipboards, due to
constraints in the API of this operating system control. Similarly,
the <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a> method for
rich-edit-pane will paste the OS clipboard rich text value if nil is
passed as the object to paste.)
</p>
<p id="23">
Typically an application can add a menu-bar command that calls <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a> (for
example) on the selected window, and then add <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a> methods for any
custom windows that don't have a suitable <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a> method built-in.
The built-in <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a> method takes care of
placing the value returned by the custom <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a> method onto the
clipboards. The built-in <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-command.htm"><b>cut-command</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> methods behave
similarly.
</p>
<p id="24">
The built-in <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-selection.htm"><b>cut-selection</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a> methods
know how to cut, copy, and paste the :text format in text-edit-pane
windows and the various controls that can edit text; how to cut, copy,
and paste the :rich-text format in rich-edit-pane windows and the
rich-edit control; and how to copy and paste the :pixmap format in
bitmap-pane windows and drawable controls (when the drawable has the
use-bitmap-stream property turned on). The built-in pixmap methods
simply draw the pixmap at its standard size at the upper left of the
window, and copy from the whole window.
</p>
<p id="25">
The default <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> method calls <a href="../operators/cg/d/default-clipboard-format.htm"><b>default-clipboard-format</b></a>
on the window where the paste is being done to determine which OS
clipboard data format to read from the clipboard. It then looks down
through the lisp clipboard stack to find an item of that type, and
calls paste-selection with that value (passing nil if nothing was
found of the desired type). If you implement a window that should know
how to paste pixmaps, for example, you could first define a
paste-selection method that draws a pixmap that's passed to it in some
way that's appropriate to that kind of window.  Then you could define
a <a href="../operators/cg/d/default-clipboard-format.htm"><b>default-clipboard-format</b></a> method on
the window class that returns the symbol :pixmap. Then whenever
<a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> is
called on the window, the default <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> method will retrieve
the current pixmap from the clipboard (if any) and call your <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a> method
for the window, passing the pixmap to paste.
</p>
<p id="26">
Note that the default <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-command.htm"><b>cut-command</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> methods recursively
call themselves on the <a href="../operators/cg/s/selected-window.htm"><b>selected-window</b></a> of the window
that's passed until they come to a child window that has no children,
and then they call <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-selection.htm"><b>cut-selection</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-selection.htm"><b>copy-selection</b></a>, or <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-selection.htm"><b>paste-selection</b></a> on that
child window. If that default behavior is not appropriate for your
application, then you need to either not use those functions or add
methods that override this behavior.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="27"><a name="adding-cut-copy-paste-1">5.0 Adding Cut/Copy/Paste commands to a menu-bar</a></h2>

<p id="28">
When creating a menu-bar programmatically, simply making menu-items
that call <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-command.htm"><b>cut-command</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a> on a window should
make them work with code written as described above.
</p>
<p id="29">
When building a form window interactively, adding a menu-bar to the
form will create an initial menu-bar with an Edit pull-down-menu that
already includes menu-items that call <a href="../operators/cg/c/cut-command.htm"><b>cut-command</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-command.htm"><b>copy-command</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/p/paste-command.htm"><b>paste-command</b></a>. For applications
that implement any sort of cut/copy/paste functionality, these
menu-items can likely be used as is.
