This document is an overview of Common Graphics functionality for
drawing arbitrary graphical output in an application, including lines
and curves, filled areas, pixmaps (bitmaps), and text. (Despite the
name, "Common Graphics" also includes windowing and event-handling
functionality and other facilities needed for a complete user
interface.) This page points to a variety of individual graphical
functions that you can link to for further information.
</p><hr><hr><h2 id="5"><a name="draw-on-1">1.0 What to draw on</a></h2>

<p id="6">
An application can draw in any window, as well as on certain special
objects such as the screen itself, printers, and memory bitmaps that
may be used to temporarily hold output to be copied to a visible
window later. A given drawing function such as <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-line.htm"><b>draw-line</b></a> will work essentially the
same no matter which type of object it is drawn on.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="7"><a name="on-windows-2">1.1 Drawing on windows in general</a></h2>

<p id="8">
When a window is the drawing destination, a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method generally
should be used to encapsulate the drawing code.  And certain types of
windows have other particular constraints, as explained in this and
the following sections.
</p>
<p id="9">
The following techniques can be used on (almost) all windows.
</p>

<h3 id="10">redisplay-window</h3>

<p id="11">
After calling <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> to create a window in
which to draw, an application could immediately start calling drawing
functions such as <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-line.htm"><b>draw-line</b></a> on the window. But
instead, an application normally should write a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method for the
window, and place all of the code that draws in the window into the
<a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>
method.
</p>
<p id="12">
The reason for always using a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method is that
whenever part of the interior of a window becomes uncovered, its
<a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>
method will be called automatically to redraw the window's contents
that was erased from the screen when the window became covered. If
drawing is done outside a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method, then in
the general case an application will not know when the output that was
drawn has been lost.
</p>
<p id="13">
To define a custom <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method, you should
(as usual) first define your own window subclass and add the method to
that, to avoid adding methods to built-in classes. The following
example shows the basic technique for defining a custom window class
and what gets drawn in the windows that are instantiated from it. A
<a href="../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a>
is the simplest type of window to draw on, and is subclassed here.
</p>

<pre id="14">
(defclass my-window (frame-window)())

(defmethod redisplay-window ((window my-window) &optional box)
  (declare (ignore box))
  (call-next-method)
  (draw-line window (make-position 0 0)(make-position 1000 1000)))

(make-window :one :class 'my-window)
</pre>

<p id="15">
When the call to <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> is done, the window is
created and is "uncovered" for the first time, and so Common Graphics
calls the <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method, which
simply draws a line in the window.  This method will be called in the
future whenever the window's interior is partly uncovered.
</p>
<p id="16">
The method above calls <code>(call-next-method)</code>. This
calls the default <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method, defined on
<a href="../classes/cg/basic-pane.htm"><code>basic-pane</code></a>,
which simply erases the entire background of the window
interior. Without this call, whatever had been on the screen before
the window was uncovered would remain in the window interior, with our
line being drawn directly on top of this screen garbage. So a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method
is responsible for drawing the entire window contents.
</p>
<p id="17">
To achieve the same effect as calling
<code>(call-next-method)</code>, a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method could
instead pass the box argument to <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-contents-box.htm"><b>erase-contents-box</b></a> to draw the
uncovered part of the window interior in the window's current <a href="../operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="18">
The optional <i>box</i> argument to <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> specifies a
rectangular portion of the window interior that includes all of the
parts that were uncovered. This argument is ignored above, but may be
used for efficiency. See <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> for details.
</p>

<h3 id="19">invalidate</h3>

<p id="20">
An application should never call <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> itself, allowing
Common Graphics to call it when needed instead. If you know that a
window needs to be redrawn for some reason that Common Graphics can't
know about (such as if its contents should change), then you should
call the function <a href="../operators/cg/i/invalidate.htm"><b>invalidate</b></a> on the window. This
tells Common Graphics that the window interior (or some part of it) is
out of date, and Common Graphics will call <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> itself.
</p>
<p id="21">
The reason for this design is that when an application and/or Common
Graphics notices that a window needs to be redrawn, this may be
noticed multiple times or in multiple places in the code. If <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> were
called in each case, the window would be redrawn multiple times when
it only needs to be redrawn once. This not only slows down the
application, but can cause annoying flashing effects. The general
solution to this problem in Common Graphics (in the operating system
design actually) is to not call <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> immediately when
<a href="../operators/cg/i/invalidate.htm"><b>invalidate</b></a> is
called, but instead to wait until the window's thread is done
responding to events, and then to call <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> the minimum
necessary number of times to account for all of the queued
invalidations.
</p>

<h3 id="22">update-window</h3>

<p id="23">
When using the above techniques involving <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> and invalidate, it
may happen that a window does not redraw itself as soon as desired,
because the gesture that uncovered the window also executed code that
consumes considerable time, and <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> is called only
afterwards. If this is a problem, an application can call <a href="../operators/cg/u/update-window.htm"><b>update-window</b></a> on the
window at the time that it should be redrawn. This causes <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> to be
called immediately rather than after the currently running code has
completed.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="24"><a name="on-particular-windows-2">1.2  Considerations for drawing on particular kinds of windows</a></h2>

<h3 id="25">frame-with-single-child windows</h3>

<p id="26">
If you were to substitute <a href="../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a> for <a href="../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a> in the
initial example in <a href="#on-windows-2">Section 1.1 Drawing on windows in general</a>, you
would not see a line drawn in the window. The reason is that this
window class is a subclass of <a href="../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a>, and so
creating an instance with <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> automatically creates a
second window in the interior of the new window to serve as a main
pane. Anything drawn on the <a href="../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a> returned by
<a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> will
not be seen because it is covered entirely by the pane. Instead you
must call <a href="../operators/cg/f/frame-child.htm"><b>frame-child</b></a> to find the pane, and
draw on the pane.
</p>
<p id="27">
The reason for this design is not that you cannot draw on a frame
window, since you can draw on any window. Instantiating a <a href="../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a>
is mainly useful if you want to add a toolbar or status-bar to the
window. If you add a toolbar to a <a href="../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a> and then draw on the
<a href="../classes/cg/frame-window.htm"><code>frame-window</code></a>,
you would need to know how tall the toolbar is in order to draw below
it. And scrolling the window (if it has scrollbars) would scroll the
toolbar right off the window. A <a href="../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a> window, on
the other hand, would place its toolbar alongside the <a href="../operators/cg/f/frame-child.htm"><b>frame-child</b></a> pane,
allowing you to draw on the pane right at the top as usual, and the
pane window will have the scrollbars rather than the frame window so
that scrolling leaves the toolbar in place.
</p>
<p id="28">
To update the first example to work with a <a href="../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a> class, you
would need to subclass the window class of the pane, since that is
where you need to define a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method. This means
that you also need to add a <a href="../operators/cg/d/default-pane-class.htm"><b>default-pane-class</b></a> method to tell
the frame window what class to use for its pane window, and so you
must also subclass the frame window class in order to add this method.
</p>
<p id="29">
Here's the example as updated to work with a custom <a href="../classes/cg/non-refreshing-window.htm"><code>non-refreshing-window</code></a>
subclass.
</p>

<pre id="30">
(defclass my-frame (non-refreshing-window)())

(defclass my-pane (non-refreshing-pane)())

(defmethod default-pane-class ((window my-frame))
  'my-pane)

(defmethod redisplay-window ((window my-pane) &optional box)
  (declare (ignore box))
  (call-next-method)
  (draw-line window (make-position 0 0)(make-position 1000 1000)))

(let* ((window (make-window :one :class 'my-frame :scrollbars t)))
  (add-toolbar window)
  (add-common-status-bar window)
  window)
</pre>

<p id="31">
The functions <a href="../operators/cg/a/add-toolbar.htm"><b>add-toolbar</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/a/add-common-status-bar.htm"><b>add-common-status-bar</b></a> are called
here to illustrate how the drawing still begins at the upper-left
corner of the drawing area (the pane window) rather than being
obscured by the (empty) toolbar.
</p>
<p id="32">
Note also how scrolling the window downward draws more of the line
that had extended off the bottom of the window. Scrolling is another
case of part of the window being uncovered, and the <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method is called
automatically to redraw the window at its new scroll position. Common
Graphics will automatically shift the part of the drawing that was
already visible and which will still be visible after the scroll, and
then call <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> with a box
argument that covers only the newly-scrolled-on part of the drawing.
The scrolling of the line will look smooth even though we draw the
whole line, because the <a href="../operators/cg/c/clipping-box.htm"><b>clipping-box</b></a> of the window is set
to the box argument during the call to <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>, so that the
shifted part of the line is not erased and then redrawn.
</p>
<p id="33">
An application does not need to concern itself with the current
<a href="../operators/cg/s/scroll-position.htm"><b>scroll-position</b></a>
of a window. Instead the app draws on the logical canvas that is
scrolled across the window, and Common Graphics maps what is drawn to
the visible window based on its current <a href="../operators/cg/s/scroll-position.htm"><b>scroll-position</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="34">
The <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> dialog has a less trivial
example of drawing on a <a href="../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a> window,
called "Custom Windows: subclassing and event-handling".
</p>

<h3 id="35">Bitmap-panes and bitmap-windows</h3>

<p id="36">
A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-window.htm"><code>bitmap-window</code></a> is another <a href="../classes/cg/frame-with-single-child.htm"><code>frame-with-single-child</code></a> window
class, and instantiates a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> as the <a href="../operators/cg/f/frame-child.htm"><b>frame-child</b></a>. A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> is a
special window that uses a backing-store memory bitmap to remember
what was drawn in it when it becomes covered.  It has a built-in
<a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>
method that simply copies the memory bitmap to the visible window when
it is uncovered.  Therefore, when using a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> you should not add a
<a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a>
method. But you do need to draw directly on the window to produce the
drawing that the window will remember from then on. So a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> is an
exception to the rule of calling invalidate rather than
drawing directly on the window.
</p>
<p id="37">
A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a>
is useful when redrawing the window contents from scratch in a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method
each time the window is uncovered is not fast enough, since doing a
single copy from the backing-store pixel array is usually faster than
this. The drawback is that a lot of memory is used for the memory
bitmap, and so you generally don't want to use <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a>s except when needed.
</p>
<p id="38">
If the contents of a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> need to change, you can
call <a href="../operators/cg/c/clear-page.htm"><b>clear-page</b></a>
to draw the window's background in the window's current <a href="../operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a>, and
then begin a new drawing. <a href="../operators/cg/c/clear-page.htm"><b>clear-page</b></a> calls <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-contents-box.htm"><b>erase-contents-box</b></a> on the <a href="../operators/cg/p/page-box.htm"><b>page-box</b></a> of the window to
erase the entire scrollable canvas (or page) of the window. Erasing
only the visible-box of a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> would not be sufficient
if the window is scrollable, because a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> also
remembers the contents that are currently scrolled out of view.
</p>

<h3 id="39">The drawable control</h3>

<p id="40">
The <a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a>
control is a widget that is provided simply to display an arbitrary
drawing on a widget that exists among other widgets. You could instead
add a regular child window to a dialog and draw on that, but the
<a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a>
control may be useful when you want to treat the drawing window as a
widget, such as by dragging it around on a form being laid out
interactively, or allowing the user to tab to it.
</p>
<p id="41">
You draw on a <a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a> control just as you would
on a regular window, except that you place the drawing code into an
<a href="../operators/cg/o/on-redisplay.htm"><b>on-redisplay</b></a>
function rather than into a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> method. A <a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a> control may
alternately have a backing store memory bitmap similar to that of a
<a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a>,
if you turn on its use-bitmap-stream property. The <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> dialog has
a complete example of using a <a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a> control.
</p>

<h3 id="42">Other widget windows</h3>

<p id="43">
Normally an application would not draw on the window of an arbitrary
widget (an instance of the class <a href="../classes/cg/dialog-item.htm"><code>dialog-item</code></a>), because each widget
is designed to be drawn in a standard way that it knows about and
handles itself. But since it is possible to draw on any window, you
can draw on a widget if you really want to. The one constraint (if the
window is of the class <a href="../classes/cg/widget-window.htm"><code>widget-window</code></a> rather than <a href="../classes/cg/lisp-widget-window.htm"><code>lisp-widget-window</code></a>) is
that the calls to drawing functions must be wrapped in a call to
<a href="../operators/cg/w/with-device-context.htm"><b>with-device-context</b></a>, since Common
Graphics does not give a permanent device context to widgets supplied
by the operating system. Such custom drawing would probably be done in
a <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> :after method to
add some sort of annotation to what the main <a href="../operators/cg/r/redisplay-window.htm"><b>redisplay-window</b></a> for the control
normally draws.
</p>

<h3 id="44">text-edit-pane</h3>

<p id="45">
Though <a href="../classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm"><code>text-edit-pane</code></a> appears in the
Common Graphics class hierarchy as a regular window, it is internally
an operating system control, and therefore knows how to draw itself
and normally is not drawn on by an application. It still can be drawn
on as with any OS control, though, and in fact the IDE editor draws
parenthesis matching marks in text-edit-panes.
</p>





<hr><h2 id="46"><a name="on-the-screen-2">1.3 Drawing on the screen</a></h2>

<p id="47">
The screen itself may be drawn on, though this is generally dangerous
because it draws over whatever windows happen to lie at the specified
screen positions (even if they are in other applications), and these
windows will not know that they have been obscured and so they will
not refresh themselves. Generally, an application would need to be
careful that it draws only over its own windows while they are in
front and that it refreshes these windows at some point by calling
invalidate on each of them. (Drawing on the screen will even draw over
window frames, which is not otherwise possible in Common
Graphics. Such drawing could be removed later by passing the :frame
argument to <a href="../operators/cg/i/invalidate.htm"><b>invalidate</b></a>.)  The screen is
returned by <code>(screen *system*)</code> (see <a href="../operators/cg/s/screen.htm"><b>screen</b></a> and <a href="../variables/cg/s_system_s.htm"><code>*system*</code></a>).
</p>
<p id="48">
One way to draw on the screen that is relatively safe is to use the
<a href="../variables/cg/po-xor.htm"><code>po-xor</code></a> (or
<a href="../variables/cg/po-invert.htm"><code>po-invert</code></a>)
paint-operation. If something is drawn twice this way, the second time
will erase what was drawn the first time, but not if someone (such as
another application) draws something in the same place between the two
calls. So caution is still warranted. The Common Graphics functions
such as <a href="../operators/cg/g/get-line.htm"><b>get-line</b></a>
and <a href="../operators/cg/g/get-screen-box.htm"><b>get-screen-box</b></a> use this technique
to temporarily draw a rubberband line or box anywhere on the
screen. The "Grabbing pixmaps from the screen" example in the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> dialog
calls get-screen-box to allow you to capture a pixmap from anywhere on
the screen.
</p>





<hr><h2 id="49"><a name="on-bitmap-streams-2">1.4 Drawing on bitmap-streams</a></h2>


<p id="50">
A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-stream.htm"><code>bitmap-stream</code></a> is a memory bitmap
that is never visible but on which you can draw just as you would on a
window. (A pixmap, on the other hand cannot be drawn on.)  <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-stream.htm"><code>bitmap-stream</code></a>s may be
useful for storing drawings that are to be very quickly copied at
various times to visible windows by calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-stream-area.htm"><b>copy-stream-area</b></a>.  A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> uses an
internal memory bitmap that is similar to a bitmap-stream, and the
<a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-stream.htm"><code>bitmap-stream</code></a>
class is provided for similar uses that don't quite fit the typical
bitmap-pane model. Call <a href="../operators/cg/o/open-stream.htm"><b>open-stream</b></a> rather than make-window
to create a <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-stream.htm"><code>bitmap-stream</code></a>. The <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> dialog has
a complete example called "Bitmap-streams: custom backing store".
</p>





<hr><h2 id="51"><a name="on-printers-2">1.5 Drawing on printers</a></h2>


<p id="52">
You can draw on a printer stream just as you would draw on a window.
There are a few special considerations: You must call <a href="../operators/cg/n/new-page.htm"><b>new-page</b></a> to advance to a
new page; the paper is not ejected until you close the stream; the
pixel resolution may be very different than the screen and vary widely
between printers (see <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-units-per-inch.htm"><b>stream-units-per-inch</b></a> and <a href="../classes/cg/scaling-stream.htm"><code>scaling-stream</code></a>), and
getting the right margins is a bit tricky due to the coordinates being
relative to a "hardware margin" (see <a href="../variables/cg/s_default-printer-left-margin_s.htm"><code>*default-printer-left-margin*</code></a>).
And you call <a href="../operators/cg/o/open-stream.htm"><b>open-stream</b></a> rather than <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> to open a
printer stream.  There are a couple of printer examples in the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> dialog
that address these issues. See also <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-output-to-printer.htm"><b>with-output-to-printer</b></a>.
</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="53"><a name="drawing-coordinates-1">2.0 Coordinates</a></h2>

<p id="54">
Drawing functions accept arguments that use a coordinate system called
"stream coordinates".  By default, the position 0,0 in stream
coordinates is at the top left of the entire "page" (or canvas) that
is scrollable in a window (when the destination is a window), and the
unit of distance is pixels.  So drawing a line from 0,3 to 100,3 will
draw a horizontal line that is 100 pixels long and which has one end
near the top-left corner of the window interior whenever the window is
scrolled to its top-left position. Common Graphics handles the
scrolling for you, so that you can effectively draw directly on the
scrollable canvas without worrying about the current <a href="../operators/cg/s/scroll-position.htm"><b>scroll-position</b></a>.

The 0,0 origin may be moved by calling the setf of <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-origin.htm"><b>stream-origin</b></a>, but this is not
typically useful.  The unit of distance may be changed by calling the
setf of <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-units-per-inch.htm"><b>stream-units-per-inch</b></a> if the stream
is a <a href="../classes/cg/scaling-stream.htm"><code>scaling-stream</code></a>; this is mainly

see <a href="cg-coordinates.htm">cg-coordinates.htm</a>.

<p id="56">
Coordinates are usually passed to drawing functions by first grouping
them into position and box objects. These are created by calling
<a href="../operators/cg/m/make-position.htm"><b>make-position</b></a> and
<a href="../operators/cg/m/make-box.htm"><b>make-box</b></a>, or
allocated temporarily by using <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-positions.htm"><b>with-positions</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-boxes.htm"><b>with-boxes</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-positions-and-boxes.htm"><b>with-positions-and-boxes</b></a>. (The
"with-" macros may be used to reduce the consing of many temporary
position and box objects). There are also many functions for combining
position and box objects in various ways, such as <a href="../operators/cg/p/position+.htm"><b>position+</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/b/box-move.htm"><b>box-move</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/i/inside-box-p.htm"><b>inside-box-p</b></a>.

A window's coordinate system applies only to its interior; there is no
way to draw on the frame of a window except by drawing directly on the
screen (see above).

<hr><hr><h2 id="58"><a name="drawing-functions-1">3.0 Drawing functions</a></h2>

Common Graphics allows you to draw lines, polygons, various curved
shapes, pixmaps (bitmaps), and text, and to fill various shapes.
There are many functions that may be found in the Help | Tree of
Knowledge dialog under Common Graphics --&gt; Graphics; this section
mentions some of the functions as an overview.

<hr><h2 id="59"><a name="drawing-lines-etc-2">3.1 Drawing lines, filling areas, and erasing</a></h2>

<p id="60">
To draw straight or curved lines, call such functions as <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-line.htm"><b>draw-line</b></a>, 
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-to-x-y.htm"><b>draw-to-x-y</b></a>, 
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-polygon.htm"><b>draw-polygon</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-circle.htm"><b>draw-circle</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-ellipse-arc.htm"><b>draw-ellipse-arc</b></a>, and
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-bezier-curve.htm"><b>draw-bezier-curve</b></a> (the
latter for Bezier curves). To fill whole areas denoted by such lines
rather than drawing the line only, call functions such as <a href="../operators/cg/f/fill-box.htm"><b>fill-box</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/f/fill-polygon.htm"><b>fill-polygon</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/f/fill-ellipse-sector.htm"><b>fill-ellipse-sector</b></a>.  A
more versatile type of fill is done by the function <a href="../operators/cg/f/flood-fill.htm"><b>flood-fill</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="61">
Lines and areas may be "erased" by calling such functions as <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-line.htm"><b>erase-line</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-contents-polygon.htm"><b>erase-contents-polygon</b></a>,
and <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-ellipse-sector.htm"><b>erase-ellipse-sector</b></a>. But keep in
mind that these functions are actually just drawing or filling the
line or area using the current <a href="../operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a> of the window
rather than the current <a href="../operators/cg/f/foreground-color.htm"><b>foreground-color</b></a> as the drawing and
filling functions do. Common Graphics does not remember "objects" that
were drawn for each of the drawing and filling functions in order to
selectively remove them from a drawing. So it usually makes sense to
use these functions only if no other part of the drawing overlaps what
is being "erased". Erasing is more commonly done to whole rectangular
areas by calling such functions as <a href="../operators/cg/c/clear-page.htm"><b>clear-page</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/e/erase-contents-box.htm"><b>erase-contents-box</b></a>.
</p>





<hr><h2 id="62"><a name="drawing-style-2">3.2 The current drawing style</a></h2>

<p id="63">
A function such as <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-line.htm"><b>draw-line</b></a> takes arguments only for
the stream to draw on and the endpoints to draw between. To control
other aspects of the line such as its width and color, an application
calls other functions and macros beforehand to establish the current
drawing style context that is used by all of the actual drawing
functions.
</p>
<p id="64">
In most cases there is a function for changing some aspect of the
current drawing style permanently (or until it is changed again), and
an associated macro for changing it only temporarily, guaranteeing
that the style will be returned to whatever it was previously when the
body of the macro call is exited. For line width, for example, the
function <a href="../operators/cg/l/line-width.htm"><b>(setf line-width)</b></a> changes the current line
width indefinitely, while the macro <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-line-width.htm"><b>with-line-width</b></a> changes it only
during the body of the macro call. The function <a href="../operators/cg/l/line-width.htm"><b>line-width</b></a> returns the line width
currently in effect.
</p>
<p id="65">
Other functions and macros for establishing the current drawing style
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="66">
<a href="../operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a>
(and <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-background-color.htm"><b>with-background-color</b></a>)
</li>
<li id="67">
<a href="../operators/cg/c/clipping-box.htm"><b>clipping-box</b></a> (and
<a href="../operators/cg/w/with-clipping-box.htm"><b>with-clipping-box</b></a>)
</li>
<li id="68">
<a href="../operators/cg/f/font.htm"><b>font</b></a> (and <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-font.htm"><b>with-font</b></a>)
</li>
<li id="69">
<a href="../operators/cg/f/foreground-color.htm"><b>foreground-color</b></a>
(and <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-foreground-color.htm"><b>with-foreground-color</b></a>)
</li>
<li id="70">
<a href="../operators/cg/l/line-dashing.htm"><b>line-dashing</b></a> (and
<a href="../operators/cg/w/with-line-dashing.htm"><b>with-line-dashing</b></a>)
</li>
<li id="71">
<a href="../operators/cg/p/paint-operation.htm"><b>paint-operation</b></a>
(and <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-paint-operation.htm"><b>with-paint-operation</b></a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p id="72">
Several style parameters may be combined into a single "graphic
context" object (see <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-graphics-context.htm"><b>copy-graphics-context</b></a>), though the
functions for individual parameters are probably handier in most
cases.
</p>

<p id="73">
On the Windows platform, an enhanced drawing style can be achieved by
binding the variables <a href="../variables/cg/s_antialiasing_s.htm"><code>*antialiasing*</code></a>, <a href="../variables/cg/s_color-gradient-filling_s.htm"><code>*color-gradient-filling*</code></a>,
<a href="../variables/cg/s_color-gradient-intensity_s.htm"><code>*color-gradient-intensity*</code></a>,
<a href="../variables/cg/s_color-gradient-direction_s.htm"><code>*color-gradient-direction*</code></a>, 
<a href="../variables/cg/s_color-gradient-blend_s.htm"><code>*color-gradient-blend*</code></a>,
and <a href="../variables/cg/s_alpha-blending_s.htm"><code>*alpha-blending*</code></a>.
</p>

<p id="74">
Each drawing style parameter affects all of the drawing functions
where it makes sense. The current <a href="../operators/cg/f/foreground-color.htm"><b>foreground-color</b></a> of a window, for
example, is used for drawing lines and filling shapes as well as for
drawing text (covered below), but not for drawing pixmaps, which
define their own colors. The <a href="../operators/cg/f/foreground-color.htm"><b>foreground-color</b></a> of a window is
usually an RGB color object, created with <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-rgb.htm"><b>make-rgb</b></a>, but may also be nil to
mean use a default color. It may also be an integer to index into a
palette; palettes are probably no longer necessary now that everyone
seems to run in true-color mode, but for more information see
<a href="cg-color-palettes.htm">cg-color-palettes.htm</a>. The value cannot be
an HLS color. You can create HLS colors (see <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-hls.htm"><b>make-hls</b></a>) but must run them through
<a href="../operators/cg/h/hls-to-rgb.htm"><b>hls-to-rgb</b></a> and
use the resulting RGB color.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="75"><a name="text-and-fonts-2">3.3 Drawing text and fonts</a></h2>

<h3 id="76">Drawing text</h3>


<p id="77">
Text is sometimes not thought of as graphical output, since so-called
"non-graphical" computer terminals can display it. But in fact
drawing a string in Common Graphics is drawing a graphic just as
drawing a polygon is, and text may be mixed freely with other
graphical output.
</p>
<p id="78">
The main Common Graphics function for drawing a string is <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-string-in-box.htm"><b>draw-string-in-box</b></a>. But
since every object on which you can draw (a window, screen,
bitmap-stream, or printer) is also a Common Lisp stream, any Common
Lisp stream output function such as <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/format.htm"><b>format</b></a> or <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/writepri.htm"><b>princ</b></a> may also be used to draw in a Common
Graphics window or other stream. Common Graphics streams are set up as
"interactive" streams, and so it should not be necessary to call
<a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> or <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a>; the strings should
instead always appear as soon as they are drawn.
</p>

<h3 id="79">The current position</h3>

<p id="80">
The Common Lisp stream output functions always start drawing at the
"current position" of a window, as set by <a href="../operators/cg/m/move-to.htm"><b>move-to</b></a> or the <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> of <a href="../operators/cg/c/current-position.htm"><b>current-position</b></a>. They also set the
current position of the stream afterwards where the text output ended;
therefore, drawing multiple strings in a row will concatenate them end
to end, similar to a text terminal (though with no forced line
wrapping). When a newline is printed to a Common Graphics stream, the
current position is moved to the <a href="../operators/cg/l/left-margin.htm"><b>left-margin</b></a> of the stream and
downward by the <a href="../operators/cg/l/line-height.htm"><b>line-height</b></a> of the stream.
</p>
<p id="81">
The current position is also used by certain other functions such as
<a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-to.htm"><b>draw-to</b></a>, though
in those cases it is probably more straightforward to use
corresponding functions such as <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-line.htm"><b>draw-line</b></a> that do not depend on the
current position.
</p>

<h3 id="82">Fonts</h3>

<p id="83">
Text is always drawn in a Common
Graphics stream using the stream's current font.
A Common
Graphics stream always has a current font, which is returned by calling
font. A stream's default font could be used, but typically an
application will want to specify its own fonts, often mixing a number
of fonts in a single window.
</p>
<p id="84">
A font is created by calling make-font-ex.  (If an existing equivalent
font is found, make-font-ex returns that font rather than creating a
new font object, so <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-font-ex.htm"><b>make-font-ex</b></a> may be called
frequently without concern of excessive consing.) <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-faces.htm"><b>font-faces</b></a> returns a list of the
faces that may be passed to <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-font-ex.htm"><b>make-font-ex</b></a>. <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-sizes.htm"><b>font-sizes</b></a> returns the available
sizes for a particular face, though a vector font (such as a TrueType
font) may be any size, unlike a raster font. <a href="../operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-font.htm"><b>ask-user-for-font</b></a> also returns a
font object, as chosen interactively by the user. Functions such as
<a href="../operators/cg/a/ansi-var-font.htm"><b>ansi-var-font</b></a> and
<a href="../operators/cg/a/ansi-fixed-font.htm"><b>ansi-fixed-font</b></a>
return suggested default fonts.
</p>
<p id="85">
Once a font object is in hand, it may be assigned to a window by
calling either <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-font.htm"><b>with-font</b></a> or the <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a> of <a href="../operators/cg/f/font.htm"><b>font</b></a>. Text that is drawn with
either <a href="../operators/cg/d/draw-string-in-box.htm"><b>draw-string-in-box</b></a> or the Common
Lisp stream output functions will then appear in this font. Functions
such as <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-string-width.htm"><b>stream-string-width</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/l/line-height.htm"><b>line-height</b></a> may be called
before a string is actually drawn to determine how much space the
string would use up.
</p>
<p id="86">
A number of functions return font attributes that may be helpful in
deciding what font to use or how much space a font will require.  Some
of the functions, such as <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-family.htm"><b>font-family</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-face.htm"><b>font-face</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-size.htm"><b>font-size</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-style.htm"><b>font-style</b></a>, may be called on a font
object directly. To use other functions, such as <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-ascent.htm"><b>font-ascent</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-leading.htm"><b>font-leading</b></a>, <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-fixed-width-p.htm"><b>font-fixed-width-p</b></a>, and <a href="../operators/cg/f/font-vector-p.htm"><b>font-vector-p</b></a>, you must
first assign the font to a stream, then retrieve a fontmetrics object
from the stream (by calling either <a href="../operators/cg/f/fontmetrics.htm"><b>fontmetrics</b></a> or <a href="../operators/cg/n/nfontmetrics.htm"><b>nfontmetrics</b></a>), and then call the
function on the fontmetrics object.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="87"><a name="pixmaps-and-icons-2">3.4 Drawing pixmaps and icons</a></h2>

<p id="88">
A <i>pixmap</i>, also known as a <i>bitmap</i> or <i>raster image</i>,
is a rectangular array of pixels that is copied as a block. Common
Graphics includes pixmap objects to encapsulate such images. A pixmap
may be loaded from a .bmp file by calling <a href="../operators/cg/l/load-pixmap.htm"><b>load-pixmap</b></a>, or created on the fly
with <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a>. A pixmap is drawn on
a stream by calling copy-to-stream. Pixmaps are described in detail in
<a href="cg-pixmaps.htm">cg-pixmaps.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="89">
A rectangular area of one stream may be copied to another stream by
calling <a href="../operators/cg/c/copy-stream-area.htm"><b>copy-stream-area</b></a>, without using
pixmap objects.
</p>
<p id="90">
An <i>icon</i> is a pixmap-like object that may be used in special
places such as window title-bars and the Windows Taskbar. They are
covered in <a href="cg-icons.htm">cg-icons.htm</a>.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="91"><a name="animation-1">4.0 Animation</a></h2>

<p id="92">
Common Graphics does not offer much direct support for animation, but
there are a few facilities that may be of help.
</p>
<p id="93">
There is a <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/navigator-dialog.htm">Navigator</a> example showing how to do
limited animation in a <a href="../classes/cg/drawable.htm"><code>drawable</code></a> control; this code is also
shown on the page for the drawable class. This example uses the
optional backing store of the drawable to quickly update the image to
each next frame.  A timer is used to update the image at regular
intervals.
</p>
<p id="94">
Similar techniques could be used with a regular window, such as
drawing the next frame of an animation on an unseen <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-stream.htm"><code>bitmap-stream</code></a>, then
using copy-to-stream to copy that next image to a visible window
whenever a timer fires. This usage of backing store avoids flashing
that would result if the next frame were drawn directly on the visible
window. This type of backing store can be done automatically by using
the <a href="../operators/cg/d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a>
window property or the <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-double-buffering.htm"><b>with-double-buffering</b></a> macro.  Timers are
detailed in <a href="cg-timers.htm">cg-timers.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="95">
A <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a>
has this sort of behavior built in when the <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-delayed-redraw.htm"><b>with-delayed-redraw</b></a> macro is used
with it. If the code to draw the next frame of an animation on a
<a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> is
placed within a call to <a href="../operators/cg/w/with-delayed-redraw.htm"><b>with-delayed-redraw</b></a>, then the
output will be sent to the <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a>'s backing-store memory
bitmap but not to the visible window itself. Then when the <a href="../classes/cg/bitmap-pane.htm"><code>bitmap-pane</code></a> is next
redisplayed (either by passing <code>:invalidate t</code> to
<a href="../operators/cg/w/with-delayed-redraw.htm"><b>with-delayed-redraw</b></a> or by calling
<a href="../operators/cg/i/invalidate.htm"><b>invalidate</b></a>
explicitly later), then the backing store will be copied quickly to
the visible window to reveal the next image.
</p>

<h3 id="96">
Example
</h3>

<p id="97">
Here is an example of a simple animation to inform the user that
something is still happening during a busy loop. It uses the <a href="../operators/cg/d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a> property to
illustrate smooth (non-flashy) updating of a drawing.
</p>
<p id="98">
It also illustrates how to draw frames at a particular speed.  Here 30
frames a second are drawn, though you would probably want to use fewer
in a real application if it were only to inform the user of progress,
as in this example.  Otherwise it would likely slow down the real task
significantly, and the real task's main loop would probably not come
around that often to check whether it's time for another frame.
