The International Version of Allegro CL, which uses 16-bit characters,
is the standard version. The older, non-international version remains
available to Allegro CL users, as described in
<a href="#8-bit-images-1">Appendix C 8-bit images</a>.
</p>
<p id="6">
The 16-bit character versions of Allegro CL allows for universal
character representation and character Input/Output that is more
flexible than that available with previous Allegro CL releases.

<p id="7">
<b>Note on examples with non-ASCII characters:</b> This document contains
some examples with non-ASCII characters to illustrate Allegro CL's ability
to represent them. These examples are displayed using JPEG pictures, and
therefore you cannot cut and paste them, as you can with examples containing
only ASCII characters.

<hr><hr><h2 id="9"><a name="internal-rep-1">2.0 Internal Representation</a></h2>

<hr><h2 id="10"><a name="history-2">2.1 History</a></h2>

<p id="11">
In Allegro CL versions 5.0.1 and earlier, the standard,
non-international, 8-bit version of Allegro CL represented characters
internally using 8-bits per numeric character code. In Allegro CL,
English letters and punctuation characters are represented using the
ASCII character set. Several non-ASCII characters in 8-bit extended
character sets, including the ISO-8859 series of character sets,
define numeric codes for non-English/non-ASCII characters. Although
non-international Allegro CL does not provide specific support to
8-bit extended character sets, all 8-bit character codes are
representable in non-international Allegro CL.
</p>
<p id="12">
The International version of Allegro CL was originally developed to
support Japanese characters of which there are too many to represent
using the standard 8-bit per character code model. Starting with
Release 6.0, Allegro CL is extended to support all international
characters (i.e., Asian, European, etc.) by using 16-bit Unicode as
the internal character representation model. The Unicode standard is
used as the internal representation model for the Windows NT/2000
Operating System as well as the Java programming language.
</p>
<p id="13">
The International version of Allegro CL has the feature
<code>:ics</code> on the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/features.htm"><code>*features*</code></a> list. The non-International version
does not have that feature.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="14"><a name="unicode-2">2.2 Unicode</a></h2>

<p id="15">
Each character, be it a letter, Chinese ideograph, Korean Hangul,
punctuation mark, or other glyph, has a unique numeric Unicode
representation value.  Please visit the Unicode Web site (<a href="http://www.unicode.org">www.unicode.org</a>) for more
information on the Unicode standard. We provide a basic description
of Unicode in this document.
</p>
<p id="16">
The characters from the Latin-1 (aka ISO 8859-1) character set, a
256 character (i.e., 8-bit) superset of the ASCII character set, have
the same values in Unicode as they do in Latin-1.  This provides
convenient compatibility for programs which depend on numeric
character codes strictly within the Latin-1 range.
</p>
<p id="17">
Characters from other sets, however, may have different values in
Unicode.  For example, the Latin-2 character "Latin Capital Letter L
With Stroke" has value #xa3 in Latin-2 (ISO 8859-2), but has value
u+0141 in unicode [we use the 'u+xxxx' convention here for describing
unicode values; 'xxxx' is in hexadecimal format].  Thus, programs
which depend on character code values of non-Latin-1 characters may
need to be examined and possibly updated to operate with Allegro CL.
Users with existing Allegro CL programs who do not wish immediately to
update their programs will be able to use the non-international, 8-bit
character based, Allegro CL which does not use Unicode to represent
characters.
</p>
<p id="18">
Note that, as described later in this document, conversions from
external format encodings, such as Latin-2, happen automatically
during Lisp Input/Output.  Thus, the only areas where user code is
likely to be affected by differences between internal character
representation among non-international and International Allegro CL
are places where the Lisp functions char-code and code-char are called
directly on non-Latin-1 characters.  For example, using the Latin-2
character "Latin Capital Letter L With Stroke", the following sessions
show the differences:
</p>

<p id="19"><img src="pictures/lslash.jpg"></p>




<hr><h2 id="20"><a name="memory-usage-2">2.3 Memory Usage</a></h2>

<p id="21">
Internally, all Lisp strings are represented as arrays of Unicode
character codes. Each array element is exactly 16-bits wide, even if
the string contains only 7-bit ASCII characters. This widening of
strings causes a memory usage increase. However, since almost all
initial Allegro CL strings are stored in memory-mapped files, the
initial runtime memory usage difference between International Allegro
CL and non-international Allegro CL is less than 5%. Users wishing to
deliver applications with their (read-only) strings in similarly
memory mapped files can use the :purify option to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>. Please see 
<a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a> for more information.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="22"><a name="char-names-2">2.4 Character names</a></h2>

<p id="23">
Lisp characters can be represented using the `#\[name]' syntax,
where [name] is the character's Unicode name. Since the Unicode
naming convention uses spaces in character names, and since the Lisp
character reader treats space as a token delimiter, #\_ (underscore)
characters are used to act as spaces in the Unicode name.  For
example, the following shows the unicode name for u+0141:
</p>
<pre id="24">
 &gt; (code-char #x0141)
 #\latin_capital_letter_l_with_stroke

 &gt; (format t &quot;u+~4,'0x&quot; (char-code #\latin_capital_letter_l_with_stroke))
 u+0141
</pre>
<p id="25">
Not all Unicode characters have names.  In particular, most CJK
(Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters are unnamed.  If you are using
Mule or the Allegro CL IDE to enter Japanese characters, though, you
can name the characters directly:
</p>

<p id="26"><img src="pictures/japanese.jpg"></p>


<p id="27">
Character names specified in ANSI Common Lisp are also recognized.
Thus, some characters have more than one name in Allegro CL:
</p>

<pre id="28">
 &gt; (format t &quot;u+~4,'0x&quot; (char-code #\latin_capital_letter_a))
 u+0041

 &gt; (format t &quot;u+~4,'0x&quot; (char-code #\A))
 u+0041
</pre>



<hr><hr><h2 id="29"><a name="external-formats-1">3.0 External formats</a></h2>

<p id="30">
As described above, International Allegro CL characters and
character strings are represented internally using the Unicode
standard with each character occupying exactly 16-bits per character
code. Externally, however, and outside of Allegro CL's control, most
non-ASCII characters are stored in variable-width multi-byte models
using any one of several different representations.
</p>
<p id="31">
For example, there are several common ways to represent Japanese
characters, and most of these encodings specify that ASCII characters
(which are non-Japanese) occupy a single 8-bit byte each, whereas
Japanese characters may occupy two or three 8-bit bytes each depending
on the character and the encoding.
</p>
<p id="32">
Allegro CL provides stream-level and foreign-function call-level
automatic translation between Unicode and several of these external
formats. We describe how external-formats are used in this section as
well as how users can define their own Unicode to External Format
translations for their own external formats.
</p>
<p id="33">
In the simple-stream implementation used by Allegro CL (see
<a href="streams.htm">streams.htm</a>), the basic unit is an <i>octet</i>,
which is an 8-bit byte. Reading and writing functions work with
octets. In this document, we typically describe behavior on octets.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="35"><a name="basic-ef-types-3">3.1.1 Basic External-Format Types</a></h2>

<p id="36">
The simplest external-format is for the Latin-1 character set. This is
the external-format used when the default locale (sometimes known as
the "C" or "POSIX" locale) is being used.  For input, the Latin-1
external-format translation simply takes the next input octet and
forms a Lisp character from the single octet's numeric value.  For
output, the external-format takes the Lisp character's code, and uses,
as its octet output, the character code value. If the Lisp character
code value is greater than 255 (i.e., what can be represented as a
Latin-1 octet), then the ASCII value for question-mark (== 63) is used
as the output octet. Thus question-marks appearing in Latin-1 output
can indicate places where non-Latin-1 characters are used.
</p>
<p id="37">
The next simplest class of external-formats are the 8-bit character
sets, such as for any of the ISO-8859 sets.  (The Latin-1 case
described above is actually ISO-8859-1).  For these external-formats,
each Lisp character corresponds to one octet.  (A special case
exception is the #\newline case described below.)  For the non-Latin-1
external-formats, the translation is generally done by fast table
lookup. The following are the names and nicknames for the 8-bit
external-formats supplied with Allegro CL:

See <a href="#unicode-and-fat-3">Section 3.1.2 The unicode and fat External-Format Types; the unicode BOM</a> for external

</p>



<hr><h2 id="46"><a name="unicode-and-fat-3">3.1.2 The unicode and fat External-Format Types; the unicode BOM</a></h2>

<p id="47">
Some external formats use precisely two bytes (16 bits) per character.
These include <code>:fat</code>
(big-endian), <code>:fat-le</code> (little-endian), and
<code>:unicode</code>. These external formats are similar, but
<code>:unicode</code> follows unicode byte-ordering
conventions. In particular, when a stream is first opened with the
unicode external-format or when a stream's external-format is changed
(via <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/stream-1.htm"><b>(setf
stream-external-format)</b></a>) to the unicode external-format, the
unicode byte-order-marker is used in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="48">
The first time a character is requested from the stream (e.g., via
read-char) a check for the unicode byte-order marker is made. If one
is found, then the stream's internal state for subsequent character
byte-ordering is set accordingly so that any necessary byte-swapping
is done automatically by the external-format convertor. If a
byte-order marker is not found, then little-endian ordering is
assumed.
</li>
<li id="49">
The first time a character is output to the stream (e.g., via
write-char) a unicode byte-order marker is written before that first
character. See <a href="operators/excl/sniff-for-unicode.htm"><b>sniff-for-unicode</b></a>.

The Unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark) is not generally used in utf-8

<hr><h2 id="54"><a name="composed-efs-3">3.1.3 Composed External-Formats</a></h2>

<p id="55">
The most abstract of external-formats in Allegro CL are the "composed"
or "composing" or "wrapper" external-formats.  (The terms "composed
external-format" and "composing external-format" are used
interchangeably in Allegro CL documentation.)  Unlike the basic
external-formats described above, which translate between Lisp
characters and octets, a composing external-format provides
translations between Lisp characters and (other) Lisp characters.
Thus, a composed external-format is created by combining a
<i>composer</i>, which is a character-to-character convertor with a
<i>composee</i>, which is a character-to-octets convertor.
</p>
<p id="56">
There are two types of composing external-formats in Allegro CL,
macro-based and encapsulating-stream-based.  The macro-based composing
external-formats were introduced in Allegro CL 6.0 and are the type of
composing external-formats created by the <a href="operators/excl/compose-external-formats.htm"><b>compose-external-formats</b></a> macro. The function
<a href="operators/excl/find-composed-external-format.htm"><b>find-composed-external-format</b></a>, introduced in
Allegro CL, can be used to compose either macro-based or
encapsulating-stream-based composing external-formats.
</p>
<p id="57">
Defining a macro-based composing external-format involves defining the
convertor macros (described later in this document) using calls to the
composee external-format's convertors.  The macros are then combined
using <a href="operators/excl/compose-external-formats.htm"><b>compose-external-formats</b></a> (or to the function
<a href="operators/excl/find-composed-external-format.htm"><b>find-composed-external-format</b></a>, which uses the
<a href="operators/excl/compose-external-formats.htm"><b>compose-external-formats</b></a>
macro).
</p>
<p id="58">
An encapsulating-stream-based composing external-format works on a
stream by internally converting that stream into an encapsulating
stream.  The base stream of the encapsulation uses the macro-based
composee external-format. The encapsulator stream operates by
converting the characters received from or sent to the base stream.
</p>
<p id="59">
The most widely used composed external-format, named :e-crlf, is an
encapsulating-stream-based composing external-format, and is used to
convert the Common Lisp #\newline character from/to the combination
#\return #\linefeed combination. The :e-crlf external-format is used
by default on the Windows platform where the textual convention is to
end each line (regardless of character set encoding) with the ASCII
octets 13 and 10 which represent 'carriage return' and 'linefeed'
respectively.
</p>
<p id="60">
On the Windows platform, the default external-format used (that which
is specified by the current locale, see
<a href="#locales-1">Section 5.0 External formats and locales</a>) is a composition of the
:e-crlf external-format and the locale-specific base external-format.
For example, on US English Windows, the default base external-format
is called :1252-base (the 1252 names the "code page" name used by
Windows for US English -- this character set is effectively the same
as Latin-1).  In this Windows environment, Allegro CL creates and uses
as default the composed external-format <code>(:e-crlf
:1252-base)</code>. In other words, all Input/Output is filtered
through a #\newline processor as well as base-level
external-format. For Japanese Windows, where the default code page is
932 (corresponding to Japanese Shift-JIS), the base external-format is
:932-base, and Allegro CL composes the :e-crlf external-format with the
:932-base external-format to create <code>(:e-crlf
:932-base)</code> as the Lisp's default external-format.
</p>
<p id="61">
The <code>:e-cr</code> external-format converts ascii `carriage
return' to/from #\Newline. Composing this external-format with a "crlf-base"
external-format effectively turns this into an external-format for the
Macintosh line-ending convention. 
</p>
<p id="62">
The function <a href="operators/excl/eol-convention.htm"><b>eol-convention</b></a>
allows determining and setting the end-of-line convention of a
stream. The default eol-convention on the Macintosh is
<code>:unix</code>. Thus Allegro CL does not automatically
compose the `cr' external-format on Macintosh platforms as is done
with the `crlf' external-format on Windows platforms. However, this is
easily done by a programmer using <a href="operators/excl/eol-convention.htm"><b>eol-convention</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="63">
At Allegro CL startup time, when the global value of <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a>, is being set, the
default external-format is set as the <a href="operators/excl/locale-external-format.htm"><b>locale-external-format</b></a> of <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a>. See also
<a href="#initial-locale-2">Section 5.1 The initial locale when Allegro CL starts up</a>.
</p>
<p id="64">
The changes made to Allegro CL 6.0 (and kept in later releases)
regarding #\newline handling can, in some cases, cause compatibility
problems for code that was explicitly handling multi-character newline
terminations. The special composing external-format
<code>crcrlf</code> is designed to work around these problems.
See <a href="#newline-1">Appendix B #\newline Discussion</a> below.
</p>
<p id="65">
The function <a href="operators/excl/crlf-base-ef.htm"><b>crlf-base-ef</b></a>
extracts the external format composed with the :e-crlf external-format
or the :crcrlf external-format when passed such a composed external

<h3 id="66">Windows/Unix Portability Notes</h3>

<p id="67">
Most external-formats supplied by Allegro CL are set up to be used
portably in either the Unix or Windows environments by acting as
aliases to appropriate lower-level "base" external-formats. This
effect can be seen by evaluating <a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a> as follows (we have left
out the addresses and you may see other differences in the printed
representations):
</p>
<pre id="68">
;; On Unix/Linux: 

(find-external-format :jis) 
  ==&gt; #&lt;external-format :jis-base&gt;

;; On Windows:
  
(find-external-format :jis) 
==&gt; #&lt;external-format :crlf-jis-base)&gt;
;; or
==&gt; #&lt;external-format ['(:e-crlf :jis-base)]&gt;
</pre>
<p id="69">
The <a href="operators/excl/crlf-base-ef.htm"><b>crlf-base-ef</b></a> function
can be used to return an external-format which strips out any composed
crlf processing. Thus, on either Unix or Windows, the following result
occurs (we have left out some of the information printed):
</p>
<pre id="70">
(crlf-base-ef (find-external-format :jis))
  ==&gt; #&lt;external-format [(crlf-base-ef :jis)]&gt;
</pre>
<p id="71">
Note that while one can specify the name of a "base" external-format
directly to find-external-format, this use is not recommended since
not only is Windows/Unix portability potentially sacrificed, but also
external-format autoloading may not properly occur when specifying
"base" external-formats.  Example:
</p>
<pre id="72">
;; The following only works if the :jis external-format 
;; is already loaded (or autoloaded) into Lisp.
;;
(find-external-format :jis-base)

;; The following has the same effect as the preceeding 
;; call, but it is more portable, and will also perform
;; any necessary external-format autoloading.

<hr><h2 id="73"><a name="defining-efs-3">3.1.4 Defining External-Formats</a></h2>

<p id="74">
An external-format object is defined in Lisp. Many external-formats
are pre-defined for and distributed with Allegro CL. Occasionally, new
external-formats may be made available after a release, either as
patches or as supplemental lisp files.
</p>
<p id="75">
Users can define their own external-formats using <a href="operators/excl/def-external-format.htm"><b>def-external-format</b></a>. Except for encapsulating
composing formats, a complete external-format object includes
translation macros specified by <a href="operators/excl/def-char-to-octets-macro.htm"><b>def-char-to-octets-macro</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/def-octets-to-char-macro.htm"><b>def-octets-to-char-macro</b></a>.  These macros are
used internally by Allegro CL to fill code templates that use
external-formats. Pre-filled versions of these templates can be built
and stored as auto-loaded fasl files using the function <a href="operators/excl/generate-filled-ef-templates.htm"><b>generate-filled-ef-templates</b></a>.
</p>


<hr><h2 id="76"><a name="retrieving-efs-3">3.1.5 Retrieving Existing External-Formats</a></h2>

<p id="77">
The <a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a>
function takes as its required argument a name and returns the
external-format whose name, or one of whose nicknames, matches the
argument. When the argument is <code>:default</code>, <a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a> returns the
external-format associated with <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> (the current locale, see
<a href="#locales-1">Section 5.0 External formats and locales</a>). If the external-format
cannot immediately be found as defined in the Lisp, then an attempt is
made to autoload the external-format definition. The string "ef-" is
concatenated with the string name of the argument and passed to the
Common Lisp <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/provider.htm"><b>require</b></a>
function. This effectively means that a module named ef-[name].fasl,
where [name] is the argument to <a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a>, is sought
and, if found, loaded. Using autoloading in this way allows Allegro CL
to have in memory only those external-formats and translation tables
that are needed.
</p>
<p id="78">
The <a href="operators/excl/find-composed-external-format.htm"><b>find-composed-external-format</b></a> function takes
two external-format arguments, a composer external-format (either
macro-based or encapsulated-based), and a composee external-format and
returns their composition.
</p>
<p id="79">
If you are preparing an application for delivery to another computer
(using <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>), and the application
will likely use arbitrary external formats, it is best if you ensure
the external formats can be found. The easiest way to ensure this is
to specify the <i>include-locales</i> keyword argument
(to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>)
true. External formats can then be loaded when they are needed. The
only ones that will be present in the application image file are the
ones loaded during the image build.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="80"><a name="ef-runtime-mode-3">3.1.6 External-Format Runtime Mode</a></h2>

<p id="81">
An external-format lacking translation macro definitions is said to be
in <i>runtime-mode</i>. This means that the external-format exists
(i.e., can be retrieved with <a href="operators/excl/find-external-format.htm"><b>find-external-format</b></a>), and other aspects of
the external-format such as its nicknames can be retrieved, but
unfilled code templates cannot be filled for that external-format.
The reason one may want an external-format to be in runtime-mode is
that if the code templates for an external-format have already been
filled by, say, having previously used <a href="operators/excl/generate-filled-ef-templates.htm"><b>generate-filled-ef-templates</b></a>, then the macro
definitions and other structures needed by the macros at their
expansion time can be deleted to save space. The <a href="operators/excl/def-ef-switch-to-runtime.htm"><b>def-ef-switch-to-runtime</b></a> macro is used to name
a function (or function object) that when funcalled clears structures
used by the macros that are not needed when the external-format is in
runtime mode. The Allegro CL <a href="operators/excl/switch-ef-to-runtime.htm"><b>switch-ef-to-runtime</b></a> function switches an
external-format to runtime mode.
</p>
<p id="82">
When an external-format is autoloaded (see
<a href="#retrieving-efs-3">Section 3.1.5 Retrieving Existing External-Formats</a> above), an attempt is
also made to autoload the pre-filled external-format code
templates. These pre-filled templates are stored in separate fasl
files, usually with names that begin with 'efft-'. If the pre-filled
templates are successfully loaded, then the just-loaded
external-format is automatically switched to runtime mode.

<hr><h2 id="83"><a name="ef-usage-2">3.2 External-Format Usage</a></h2>

<hr><h2 id="84"><a name="streams-3">3.2.1 Streams</a></h2>

<p id="85">
The Lisp <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a>
function (and, analagously, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/load.htm"><b>load</b></a> and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/compile-.htm"><b>compile-file</b></a>) takes an
<i>external-format</i> keyword argument argument. If
this argument is not specified, a default external-format, based on
the current locale (see
<a href="#locales-1">Section 5.0 External formats and locales</a> below) is
used. (See <a href="implementation.htm#extensions-to-open-3">cl:open</a>
in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a> for a general discussion of
the implementation of <b>open</b> but note all discussion of the
<i>external-format</i> argument is here.)
</p>
<p id="86">
When an operation requests to read an input character stream's next
character, the stream's external-format template(s) will request one
or more octets from the buffered stream device which it then
translates into a Lisp character. Similarly, for writing Lisp
characters via streams, the external-format is used to translate the
Lisp character code in Unicode to the octet(s) specified by the
external-format translation.
</p>
<p id="87">
A stream's external-format can be changed at arbitrary times, using
<code>(setf (stream-external-format ...) ...)</code>. If it is
changed to be an external-format for which readers/writers are not
already built, the Lisp compiler is invoked to build a new associated
reader/writer in the stream for that external-format. Since the
external-format translation routines are defined using macros, the
Lisp compiler is used to build new readers/writers, thus keeping
runtime stream overhead from external-format processing to the
bare minimum.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="88"><a name="string-ef-arrays-3">3.2.2 String &lt;-&gt; External-Format Lisp Arrays</a></h2>

<p id="89">
When defining a new external-format, the <a href="operators/excl/string-to-octets.htm"><b>string-to-octets</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/octets-to-string.htm"><b>octets-to-string</b></a> functions are a convenient

<p id="94">
The first value returned by string-to-octets is the octet array in EUC

the null-terminating 0 which is added by string-to-octets (and not by
the external-format).
</p>





<hr><h2 id="95"><a name="ef-in-8bit-2">3.3 External-Formats in 8-bit Lisp.</a></h2>

<p id="96">
External-Formats are defined to convert octets to/from Lisp Unicode
characters. Thus, they are only fully supported in the standard
Allegro CL International (i.e., 16-bit) images, which are those using
the 16-bit executable like <i>mlisp</i> and
<i>alisp</i>. (On Windows, the executables have
extension <i>exe</i>.) See <a href="startup.htm#executable-names-1">Allegro CL Executables</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for information on the various images
and executables.
</p>
<p id="97">
But external-formats are also available, in a limited way, in
non-international (i.e., 8-bit) Lisps (those using
the 8-bit executable like <i>mlisp8</i> and
<i>alisp8</i>). 
</p>
<p id="98">
Their usage is limited because it is an error in an 8-bit Lisp to
create a Lisp character with a code exceeding 255. For example, one
cannot use an external-format to create a Unicode Japanese Lisp
character in an 8-bit Lisp. One can safely, however, use the latin-1
external-format in an 8-bit Lisp (which is, in fact, the default
external-format in an 8-bit Lisp) without any problems because it
never creates a character with code exceeding 255. Multi-Byte
external-formats, such as utf-8, can also be used, but only for
characters whose <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/char-co0.htm"><b>char-code</b></a>
does not exceed 255. Furthermore, the <code>:crlf</code> composing
external-format can also be used (and is, in fact, used on Windows
platforms) because it only deals with ASCII character codes.
</p>
<p id="99">
As described in <a href="#unicode-and-fat-3">the earlier
section on Unicode</a> in this document, a non-Latin1
8-bit character is represented in an 8-bit Lisp with its character
code being its native 8-bit (non-Unicode) encoding. In other words, no
conversion between octets and Lisp character char-codes is meant to
take place. This is, in fact, exactly how the
Allegro CL latin1 external-format operates. The latin1
external-format is in effect a pass-through convertor. Thus, even
if an 8-bit Lisp application knowingly handles non-Latin1 Lisp
characters, there is generally no need to specify an external-format
other than the default, latin1, external-format.

<code>:default</code>, the returned external-format will be that
stored in <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a>.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="102"><a name="foreign-functions-1">4.0 Foreign-Functions</a></h2>


<p id="103">
In C, the 'char' type is equivalent to an 8-bit byte.  A C string is
represented as an array of 8-bit bytes terminated by the null (or 0)
byte. Therefore, a C routine expecting a 'char *' argument may expect
a null-terminated 8-bit character array (i.e., string) in this format.
</p>
<p id="104">
The Allegro CL Foreign-Function Interface allows users/programmers
to pass Lisp strings to C routines expecting 'char *' arguments.
Since Allegro CL internally null-terminates lisp string objects,
passing a lisp string to a foreign function simply means internally
passing the address to the first character of the lisp string's array.
</p>
<p id="105">
The previous Allegro CL string-passing mechanism described above
breaks down in the International version since the internal character
codes of the lisp string's array are in Unicode, and non-ASCII
characters may not match the codes in the locale's native (or
external) format.  Furthermore, even for ASCII-only strings, a 'char
*' argument expects its value to be in a format where ASCII characters
are 1-byte per character.  International Allegro CL represents all
characters, including ASCII characters, as 2-bytes per character.  The
upper byte of each ASCII character is always zero.  Therefore, even if
a user wishes to pass an ASCII-only string from Allegro to a foreign
function, the foreign function will most likely treat the string
argument as truncated since the first upper (all-zero) byte will be
regarded as the string terminator.
</p>
<p id="106">
One solution offered to this
problem was to provide a macro, called <a href="operators/excl/with-native-string.htm"><b>with-native-string</b></a>, to be used around all
foreign-function calls that pass strings. This macro is used to
convert string arguments to native format using a dynamic-extent array
of 8-bit bytes.
</p>
<p id="107">
Even with the <a href="operators/excl/with-native-string.htm"><b>with-native-string</b></a> solution, users porting
foreign function code from earlier releases of Allegro CL to
International Allegro CL would have to manually hunt down every
string-passing foreign function call in order to wrap those calls with
<a href="operators/excl/with-native-string.htm"><b>with-native-string</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="108">
In order to save users from this burden, Allegro CL has a
keyword argument :strings-convert to <a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a>. The default
value of this argument is true.
</p>
<p id="109">
<a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a> creates a
low-level function that actually calls out to the foreign
code. When :strings-convert is true, arguments declared directly
or indirectly as <code>(* :char)</code> at def-foreign-call time
are handled specially. The low-level function is augmented so that for
each <code>(* :char)</code> declared argument, a check is made
at runtime to see if that declaration's corresponding value is a
string.  If it is, then that value is converted at runtime to
native-string format using a dynamic-extent array, and this new array
is passed in place of the original string argument to the
foreign function call.
</p>
<p id="110">
Since this runtime search for string arguments only happens for those
arguments declared directly or indirectly as <code>(*
:char)</code>, no new code is introduced for foreign functions not
expecting strings. Consequently, no checking is introduced if the
arguments are specified as a <code>&rest</code> list.
</p>
<p id="111">
Suppose we have a C function which takes two input string arguments
and one output string argument defined as follows:
</p>

<pre id="112">
 /*
  * concatenates first two arguments,
  * returns result in third output argument.
  */

 myconcat(char *st1, char *st2, char *retval)

To call this function from Allegro CL using the foreign function

                                       (vector (unsigned-byte 8))))
      :returning :int)

<p id="115">

type <code>ff:strings-convert-def-warning</code>) to be
signaled:
</p>

<pre id="116">

	  `st1' to the foreign-function `myconcat'.  The with-native-string

 	  is suppressed when :strings-convert is specified as nil in the
 	  def-foreign-call.
</pre>

<p id="117">
Disregarding the warnings for the moment, and continuing on to use the
just-defined foreign function, note that we can call it with lisp string
arguments:
</p>

<pre id="118">
user(22): (let ((x (make-array 500 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
             (myconcat "abc" "def" x)
             (octets-to-string x))
"abcdef"
6
6
</pre>

<p id="119">
The returned value, "abcdef", which is the concatenation of the first
two arguments (performed by the C foreign function) is correctly
returned.
</p>
<p id="120">
To turn the example above into one which (a) doesn't generate the
warnings, and (b) generates faster runtime code since string
conversion checking will be suppressed, one can set the
<i>strings-convert</i> keyword argument to false as
follows:
</p>

<pre id="121">
(ff:def-foreign-call myconcat ((st1 (* :char))
                               (st2 (* :char))
                               (result (* :void)))
     :strings-convert nil
     :returning :int)
</pre>

<p id="122">
By specifying :strings-convert to nil, the foreign-function interface
will not automatically convert string arguments. Thus, to call the
foreign-function defined this way, one needs to pass converted string
arguments as follows:
</p>

<pre id="123">
user(23): (let ((x (make-array 500 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
             (with-native-string (st1 "abc")
               (with-native-string (st2 "xyz")
                 (myconcat st1 st2 x)))
             (octets-to-string x))
"abcxyz"
6
6
</pre>

<p id="124">
It is instructive to note what happens when :strings-convert is nil,
yet the string arguments are not converted:
</p>

<pre id="125">
user(24): (let ((x (make-array 500 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
             (myconcat "abc" "def" x)
             (octets-to-string x))
"ad"
2
2
</pre>

<p id="126">
The result is the first character of the first string concatenated
with the first character of the second string. The reason this
happens is that the C foreign function sees the unconverted arguments
as Unicode strings with each element being two octets wide. To the C
function, each argument appears as the first octet being an ASCII
character, and the second octet being a string NULL terminator.
</p>
<p id="127">
Note that on big-endian platforms, the result of the above form
is "" (i.e., the empty string). That's because the Unicode Ascii values
have zero in their upper-bytes, and any array of Unicode Ascii values
appear to C routines as being zero-length null-terminated strings.
</p>
<p id="128">
Note that neither setting of the <i>strings-convert</i>
keyword argument affects foreign function return results or "output"
variables. Users with foreign function code that expects to "fill in"
Lisp strings directly will need to modify those calls to pass octet
arrays and do conversions, e.g., with <a href="operators/excl/octets-to-string.htm"><b>octets-to-string</b></a> as shown above
for the example's third argument.

The initial locale (that is, the initial value of <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a>) can be determined
in various ways. Note that the variable is first set to a locale
that (presumably) always exists. It is only reset if valid locales
are determined from the additional steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="142">
Initially, <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is
set to <code>(find-locale "C")</code> (see <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>). This becomes the default value
for <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> if the
following tests fail.
</li>
<li id="143">
If the environment variable <code>ACL_LOCALE</code> is set, then
Allegro CL attempts to look up, using <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>, the Lisp locale object named by
<code>ACL_LOCALE</code>. If a corresponding lisp locale object
is found, then <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is set to this object.
</li>
<li id="144">
If the environment variable <code>ACL_LOCALE</code> is not set,
then Allegro CL attempts to look up, using <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>, the Lisp locale object named by a
call to <code>setlocale(LC_CTYPE)</code>. (This is the portable
Operating Systems level way to look up a locale on both Windows and
Unix.) If a corresponding lisp locale object is found, then <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is set to this
object. <strong>Note:</strong> the Operating System is polled, as
described in this step, only if <code>ACL_LOCALE</code> is not
set. If <code>ACL_LOCALE</code> is set but its value is bogus
(i.e. <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a> returns
<code>nil</code> on the value) the value of <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is its inital value
<code>(find-locale "C")</code> and will only be changed, if at
all, by the next step.

If the <code>-locale</code> command-line argument is specified
(see <a href="startup.htm#command-line-args-1">Command line arguments</a>

the argument value. If a corresponding lisp locale object is found,
then <a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a> is set
to this object. Thus, using <code>-locale</code> effectively
overrules any environmental setting of LC_CTYPE or ACL_LOCALE. Note
that this step is performed when command-line argument processing is
done. All the steps above are done earlier in the startup
procedure. See <a href="startup.htm#start-up-description-1">What Lisp does when it starts

<p id="153">
<i>Localization</i> is the process of modifying a program or
application so that attributes specific to the location where the
program or application is being run are used. Such attributes include
such things as how dates are represented (day/month/year vs
month/day/year) and the glyph for currency (e.g. $ meaning United
States dollars) and whether the symbol appears before or after the amount.
</p>
<p id="154">
This section and its subsections describe localization support in
Allegro CL.
</p>


<hr><h2 id="155"><a name="locale-intro-2">6.1 Introduction to locales</a></h2>

<p id="156">
A locale is a Lisp object which contains linguistic, cultural, and
governmental rules and conventions. The Lisp locale concept is based
on the C-based POSIX locale specification. At runtime, Lisp locales
operate independently of any active POSIX locales except that at Lisp
startup time, the initial default Lisp locale (stored in the variable
<a href="variables/excl/s_locale_s.htm"><code>*locale*</code></a>) is
set using the process' current POSIX locale setting.
</p>
<p id="157">
A POSIX locale has attributes from several categories.  The following
list shows the major categories, including a brief overview
description of how they are used by Allegro CL. Further details follow
the list.
</p>
<ul>

<li id="158">
<code>LC_MONETARY</code>: Used to specify currency display
information.  Allegro CL supports this by defining a function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-print-monetary.htm"><b>locale-print-monetary</b></a>.  A
related function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-format-monetary.htm"><b>locale-format-monetary</b></a>, can be used
with Lisp format's ~/ directive. The principal argument to these
functions (and the directive) is a number. See <a href="operators/excl/locale-format-monetary.htm"><b>locale-format-monetary</b></a> description for more
information.
<p id="159">
There are no plans at this time to support parsing monetary
information.
</p>
</li>
<li id="160">
<code>LC_NUMERIC</code>: Used to specify locale-dependent
numeric display information (i.e., thousands separator, grouping, and
decimal point indicator). Allegro CL supports this by defining a
function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-print-number.htm"><b>locale-print-number</b></a>.  A related
function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-format-number.htm"><b>locale-format-number</b></a>, can be used
with Lisp format's ~/ directive. The principal argument to these
functions (and the directive) is a number. 
<p id="161">
The Allegro CL Lisp reader will not be modified to parse numbers in
locale numeric display format, but a new function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-parse-number.htm"><b>locale-parse-number</b></a>, is added to
create a Lisp number from a string representing a number in the locale
numeric display format.
</p>
</li>
<li id="162">
<code>LC_TIME</code>: Used to specify locale-specific date/time
display information. Allegro CL supports this by defining the function
<a href="operators/excl/locale-print-time.htm"><b>locale-print-time</b></a>. A related
function, <a href="operators/excl/locale-format-time.htm"><b>locale-format-time</b></a>, can be used
with Lisp format's ~/ directive. The principal argument to these
functions (and the directive) is a universal time (as returned by
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/get-univ.htm"><b>get-universal-time</b></a>).
</li>
<li id="163">
<code>LC_COLLATE</code>: Used to specify character collation
sequences.  At this time, Allegro CL does not support this category.
Allegro CL collation uses Unicode Collation Element tables which are
specified independently from locales.  (See <a href="#collation-1">Section 7.0 String collation with international characters</a>
for more information).
</li>
<li id="164">
<code>LC_CTYPE</code>: Used to specify charset information for
non-ASCII characters. This category is not used in Allegro CL where
all characters are represented in Unicode.
</li>
<li id="165">
<code>LC_MESSAGES</code>: Used to specify translation texts.  At
this time, Allegro CL does not have plans to support this category.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="166">Other Categories</h3>

<p id="167">
A locale may include other categories (e.g., for specifying postal
address information, salutations, etc.).  Allegro CL does not provide
any particular support for such other categories except to retain
their information in the locale object and make it available to user
programs via <a href="operators/excl/locale-attribute.htm"><b>locale-attribute</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="168">
The names and meanings of locale attributes are not given in this
document. They are available from Operating System Documentation. On
LINUX, <code>man 5 locale</code>. On other UNIX, <code>man 4
locale</code>, or <code>man localedef</code> provide the
information. On Windows, the <code>localeconv</code> in the
Run-Time Library Reference in the MSDN documentation has it.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="169"><a name="locale-definition-2">6.2 Locale Definition</a></h2>

<p id="170">
In Allegro CL, a locale is effectively a set of attribute/value pairs.
These pairs are sectioned into categories as defined by POSIX. Each
attribute name is unique in the locale. In other words, within a
single locale, no category can specify an attribute with the same name
as a different category's attribute (this requirement seems to be
specified by POSIX). In addition to attribute/value pairs, a Lisp
locale also holds slots containing (1) the locale's name, and (2) the
locale's default external-format.
</p>
<p id="171">
Lisp locales are defined in Lisp using <a href="operators/excl/load-localedef.htm"><b>load-localedef</b></a>.  The <a href="operators/excl/load-localedef.htm"><b>load-localedef</b></a> function
takes two arguments: A pathname and a localename. The default for the
localename is the pathname's name field. The pathname names a
localedef source file. Several localedef source files are included
with Allegro CL. These definitions come from the IBM Universal Locales
project.  They can be found in the directory specified by <a href="variables/excl/s_locales-dir_s.htm"><code>*locales-dir*</code></a>.
</p>
<p id="172">
We do not document the format of a localedef file, although platform
operating system documentation may be available.  On Linux platforms,
one can look at the man entries for locale(5) and localedef(1).  The
localedef file format is in ASCII, and is mostly self-descriptive in
case a user wishes to make local customizations.
</p>
<p id="173">
The localedef file does not include external-format information.
After <a href="operators/excl/load-localedef.htm"><b>load-localedef</b></a> parses the input
file and creates the appropriate attribute/value pairings, the
external-format is determined by looking to see if a charset is
specified in the locale name (using the &quot;.[charset]&quot; specification).
If the name does not specify the external-format, then Allegro CL uses
a [language -&gt; external-format] table which is kept in Lisp.
</p>
<p id="174">
Locales are found with <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>. The function <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a> takes a single string-designator
argument, <i>name</i>, and returns the locale specified
by <i>name</i>. Please see the documentation page of
<a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a> for information
about how locales are returned and/or created based on its argument.
</p>

<p id="175">
A locale is a class. Accessors to slots include <a href="operators/excl/locale-name.htm"><b>locale-name</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/locale-external-format.htm"><b>locale-external-format</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="176">
The function
<a href="operators/excl/locale-attribute.htm"><b>locale-attribute</b></a>
can be used to access an attribute of a locale.
</p>
<p id="177">
The function <a href="operators/excl/merge-locale-categories.htm"><b>merge-locale-categories</b></a> enables users to
create a locale object which combines all of a specified locale with
categories from other existing
locales.  Such a locale is unnamed (i.e., its name slot is nil), and
is never returned by <a href="operators/excl/find-locale.htm"><b>find-locale</b></a>.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="178"><a name="locale-attributes-2">6.3 Locale Attribute Accessors</a></h2>

<p id="179">
A locale object holds the attributes conceptually in the same way as
specified in the localedef file.  As specified above, the
locale-attribute function can be used to obtain the value of any
attribute.  However, since some of the attribute names and values are
oriented to C programming, Allegro CL provides a more Lisp-appropriate
interface to the attributes used in the localedef files.  This
alternate interface provides the following two features:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="180">
For attribute names, the dash character is used instead of the
underscore character. For example,
<pre id="181">
 (locale-int-curr-symbol locale)
 == (locale-attribute locale "int_curr_symbol" :category "LC_MONETARY")
</pre>
</li>
<li id="182">
Accessors for known boolean attributes, which are specified in the
localedef file using 0 or 1, return Lisp true and false.  For example,
<pre id="183">
 (locale-p-cs-precedes locale)
 == (eql 1 (locale-attribute locale "p_cs_precedes" :category "LC_MONETARY"))
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="184">
Note that attributes with multiple-values, such as for the list of
abbreviated months, are specified in the localedef file using the
semi-colon (`;') delimiter. When parsed by <a href="operators/excl/load-localedef.htm"><b>load-localedef</b></a>, these values create
Lisp lists.  Also, string characters are represented using Unicode.
For example, the `abmon' (abbreviated month names) category may be
specified in a localedef as follows ('/' is the escape character):
</p>
<pre id="185">
 abmon       &quot;&lt;U004A&gt;&lt;U0061&gt;&lt;U006E&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U0046&gt;&lt;U0065&gt;&lt;U0062&gt;&quot;;/
	     &quot;&lt;U004D&gt;&lt;U0061&gt;&lt;U0072&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U0041&gt;&lt;U0070&gt;&lt;U0072&gt;&quot;;/
	     &quot;&lt;U004D&gt;&lt;U0061&gt;&lt;U0079&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U004A&gt;&lt;U0075&gt;&lt;U006E&gt;&quot;;/
	     &quot;&lt;U004A&gt;&lt;U0075&gt;&lt;U006C&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U0041&gt;&lt;U0075&gt;&lt;U0067&gt;&quot;;/
	     &quot;&lt;U0053&gt;&lt;U0065&gt;&lt;U0070&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U004F&gt;&lt;U0063&gt;&lt;U0074&gt;&quot;;/
	     &quot;&lt;U004E&gt;&lt;U006F&gt;&lt;U0076&gt;&quot;;&quot;&lt;U0044&gt;&lt;U0065&gt;&lt;U0063&gt;&quot;
</pre>
<p id="186">
The lisp value for the abmon slot in a corresponding Lisp locale would
be as follows:
</p>
<pre id="187">
 (locale-attribute locale &quot;abmon&quot; :category &quot;LC_TIME&quot;)

==&gt; 
(&quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot;)
</pre>
<p id="188">
Note that, in particular, POSIX locales define LC_NUMERIC `grouping'
and LC_MONETARY `mon_grouping' as strings.  In Lisp, these categories
are defined as lists, or, if the category has a single value, an
integer.  A -1 value in these grouping attributes corresponds to the
POSIX CHAR_MAX specification.

<hr><hr><h2 id="217"><a name="collation-1">7.0 String collation with international characters</a></h2>

<p id="218">
Allegro CL provides string comparison functions such as
<b>string&lt;</b> and <b>string&gt;</b>. These functions operate by
doing binary comparisons of their argument arrays using the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/char-co0.htm"><b>char-code</b></a> values of the
characters in the arrays. The effect of these functions is to compute
the lexicographic order of their argument strings based on the array
element char-code (Unicode) values.
</p>
<p id="219">
For English-only characters, Unicode order is alphabetic except that
upper case characters have lower code value than lower case
characters. Thus, one problem with simple <b>string&lt;</b>
comparisons, which
may concern some users, is that any string beginning with an uppercase
letter will always be ordered before any string beginning with a
lowercase letter.
</p>
<p id="220">
Another problem is that with accented, or unicode-combined characters,
simple <b>string&lt;</b> ordering causes all such characters to be
ordered after all Ascii characters.
</p>
<p id="221">
Further problems include that different cultures order the same
letters differently; that in some languages characters may be combined
to form a single letter (e.g., "ch" in Spanish); and other characters
may be equivalent to two or more letters (e.g., the "ae" ligature).
</p>
<p id="222">
To address these problems, Allegro CL supports tools which parse and
utilize Unicode Collation Element Tables for string collation.  The
Unicode Organization has defined a default ordering.  Allegro CL uses
this ordering by default.
</p>
<p id="223">
The collation ordering can be customized by creating and loading
alternate unicode collation element tables into Lisp.  (The current
Default Unicode Collation Element Table is provided in the following
data file: <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt</a>.)
The tables themselves are Ascii files.  Their format is not documented here,
but is described in
the Unicode Technical Standard #10. Links to versions of that document are given in
<a href="#unicode-links-1">Appendix D Links to Unicode Reports</a>. The <a href="operators/excl/parse-ucet.htm"><b>parse-ucet</b></a> function can be used to load one or
more collation element tables into Lisp (which will be in addition to
the one already present for default Unicode collation behavior). The
<a href="operators/excl/parse-ucet.htm"><b>parse-ucet</b></a> function creates
a Lisp ucet (Unicode Collation Element Table) object.
</p>
<p id="224">
The function <a href="operators/excl/string-sort-key.htm"><b>string-sort-key</b></a>
takes as arguments a string and a ucet object (as well as additional
arguments). The function returns a string. The main property of
<a href="operators/excl/string-sort-key.htm"><b>string-sort-key</b></a>'s return
value is that it can be used as an ordering key for <b>string&lt;</b>
or <b>string&gt;</b>. In other words, if string A is to be collated
before string B relative to the table which is the value of
<code>ucet</code>, then
</p>
<pre id="225">
(string&lt; (string-sort-key A :ucet ucet) (string-sort-key B :ucet ucet))
</pre>
<p id="226">
is true.
</p>
<p id="227">
If the <code>:ucet</code> argument is not specified,
<code>(string-sort-key A)</code> returns a sort key relative to
the Default Unicode Collation Element Table, already present in
Lisp. Because this default Lisp ucet object already exists for
Allegro CL, and there is thus no need to use <a href="operators/excl/parse-ucet.htm"><b>parse-ucet</b></a> for default Unicode collation
behavior; it is only needed when you wish to define your own
collation.

In previous releases of International Allegro CL for UNIX, EUC was the

in Release 6.2 on UNIX. This functionality, which mostly
consists of character type definitions listed below, is moved into a

Because of incompatibilities between the UNIX and Windows Operating
Systems with respect to textual line termination, a special keyword
argument, <code>:mode</code> was added to the <b>cl:open</b>
function. This flag determined whether a stream would read one or two
characters when a text line was terminated. With #\newline handling
integrated into external-formats, this flag is no longer needed.  A

<p id="266">
<i>name</i> should be a symbol.
<i>list</i> should be a list of index/value pairs.
<i>index-key</i>, and <i>value-key</i>

<b>excl::build-trie</b> builds a trie data structure consisting of the
data from list. A trie data structure holds index/value pairs where
most of the values are the same default value. The trie structure does
not store these default values for each index, thus saving space and
making lookup more efficient. It is not necessary for users to know
details of trie data structures.
</p>
<p id="268">
The list argument names a list of index/value pairs for the trie. The
index-key is a function which when applied to a pair returns the index
of the pair. The value-key is a function which when applied to a pair
returns the value of the pair.
</p>
<p id="269">
If the optimize argument is true, then any rows in the resulting trie
that would be equalp to any rows in any of the tries returned by
excl::all-tries are shared.  The result is that all equalp rows of all
existing tries which are equalp become eq.

<hr><hr><h2 id="277"><a name="newline-1">Appendix B: #\newline Discussion</a></h2>

<p id="278">
ANSI Common Lisp specifies that the single character #\newline
denotes the end of a character text line.  This requirement is
complicated by the lack of a uniform convention among Operating
Systems regarding textual line endings. To end a line, UNIX based
applications generally uses Ascii 10; Macintosh based, Ascii 13; and
Windows based applications use two Ascii characters: 13 followed by
10.
</p>
<p id="279">
To confuse things further, Common Lisp implementations also differ
on which Ascii character code is used for #\newline.  Some use 13,
others use 10.  Some Common Lisp implementations may have disregarded
the ANSI requirement that a single newline character be returned at
the ends of lines, and for Windows, where two character bytes denote
line endings, return more than one character at the end of a line.
</p>
<p id="280">
Allegro CL has an external-format processing mechanism for handling
character I/O.  Using this mechanism, developed initially for
multi-byte international characters, several adjacent external bytes
may translate to a single Common Lisp character.  A natural use of
this mechanism is to map external end-of-line markers to/from the
single Common Lisp #\newline character. The function <a href="operators/excl/eol-convention.htm"><b>eol-convention</b></a> specifies what a #\newline
translates to in a stream.
</p>
<p id="281">
Specifically, for Windows the newline processing is handled using a
composing external-format. The exact description is as follows:
</p>
<pre id="282">
Standard Translation:
---------------------

Characters -&gt; External Octets:

 Lisp Character                         External Octet Sequence
 --------------                         -----------------------

  #\return  -----------------------------&gt;  13
  #\newline [eq #\linefeed]  ------------&gt;  13 10

External Octets -&gt; Characters:

 External Octet Sequence               Lisp Character
 -----------------------               --------------
 
  13 10  -------------------------------&gt;  #\newline [eq #\linefeed]
  13  ----------------------------------&gt;  #\return
  10  ----------------------------------&gt;  #\linefeed [eq #\newline]
</pre>
<p id="283">
One effect of this translation is that since #\linefeed is the same
as #\newline, '#\return #\linefeed' translates to '13 13 10'.  This
scenario is only likely to be noticed if a program deliberately
inserts the '#\return #\linefeed' sequence into a string that is to be
converted to external format.
</p>
<p id="284">
A fix for this situation is for the user/programmer simply to use
'#\newline' instead of the '#\return #\linefeed' sequence.  For
users/programmers not immediately able to make this change, a
compatibility mode exists in the form of an alternate composing
external-format which translates as follows:
</p>

Compatibility Translation:

  [ADD] #\return #\linefeed [eq #\newline]  -----&gt;  13 10

</pre>
<p id="286">
Note that the new rules allow the external octet sequence '13 13 10'
to be preserved after undergoing a round-trip conversion via Lisp
characters.
</p>
<p id="287">
Use of the compatibility mode is only supported at lisp startup time
via a new <code>-compat-crlf</code> command-line argument
(see <a href="startup.htm#command-line-args-1">Command line arguments</a>

<p id="289">
Standard Allegro CL supports international characters and uses two
bytes (16 bits total) for each character. 8-bit characters are not
supported in standard Allegro CL. However, 8-bit versions of Allegro
CL are supplied. The 8-bit executables have `8' in their names
(<i>mlisp8</i>, etc.) While most users will likely use the standard
version, some (particularly those who manipulate very large ASCII
strings) may wish to use the 8-bit version. Note that the 8-bit
version does not support 16-bit strings or characters and fasl files
are incompatible between the two versions.
