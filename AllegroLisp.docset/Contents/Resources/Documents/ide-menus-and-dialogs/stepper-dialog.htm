<p id="3"><img src="../pictures/stepper-dialog.jpg"></p>

<p id="4">
The Stepper Dialog allows carefully testing compiled code by
interrupting execution at selected forms in the original source code
and at macroexpansions of the code, allowing state to be examined at
each stop point. The illustration shows the Stepper Dialog stepping
through the <b>fact</b> function, which calculates a the factorial of
its argument. The definition of <b>fact</b> is shown as described
below.
</p>
<p id="5">
The dialog displays the original lisp source code for a function or
method that is being stepped through, highlighting the form at which
the stepper is stopped.  Button widgets allow proceding in various
ways each time execution has been interrupted.  The dialog also
displays macroexpanded forms and the values of arguments and local
variables, updated after each step.  The IDE's code editor can be
invoked at any time on the code being stepped through.
</p>
<p id="6">
The dialog is implemented on top of the base lisp's stepping facility,
which also has a simpler textual interface that can be used in a lisp
listener.  See <a href="../debugging.htm#ldb-stepper-1">The
Lisp DeBug (ldb) stepper</a> and <a href="../debugging.htm#source-step-1">The source stepper</a>, both
in <a href="../debugging.htm">debugging.htm</a>.
</p>
<p id="7">
In the IDE, stepping will be done in the Stepper Dialog if it is
present when a breakpoint is hit, and otherwise textual stepping will
be done in the listener.  The Stepper Dialog is <i>present</i> if it
has been shown by using the <a href="run-menu.htm#stepper-dialog">Run | Stepper Dialog</a>
command and has not been closed or iconized more recently, and so it
is still present if it is simply buried by other windows.  (It's
recommended that you do not show or close the Stepper Dialog while
stopped at a step, or these two modes may become confused.)
</p>
<h2 id="8">
Setting Up a Stepping Session
</h2>
<p id="9">
In order to successfully step through source code, it's important to
do some setup in the right order.  Here are the general steps, as it
were, for setting up source-level stepping:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="10">
<b>Show the Stepper Dialog</b> with the menu bar
command <a href="run-menu.htm#stepper-dialog">Run | Stepper Dialog</a>.
</li>
<li id="11">
<b>While the Stepper Dialog is present, use IDE menu bar commands to
compile and load some code to test</b>.  These commands
include <a href="file-menu.htm#compile-and-load">Compile and Load</a> (for a
file), <a href="tools-menu.htm#full-compile">Tools | Full Compile</a> (for the current
project), and <a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-compile">Tools | Incremental Compile</a> (for a
single definition in the editor). Using an IDE compilation command
while the Stepper Dialog is present ensures that the necessary
debugging information is available for doing source-level stepping.
<p id="12">
<b>One caveat</b>: <a href="file-menu.htm#compile-and-load">Compile and Load</a> does not recompile
the code if there is an up-to-date fasl file.  To ensure
recompilation, you could use <a href="file-menu.htm#compile">Compile</a> followed
by <a href="file-menu.htm#load">Load</a>. Or first save a buffer in the editor to
ensure that the fasl is no longer newer, and then
use <a href="file-menu.htm#compile-and-load">Compile and Load</a>. Status bar messages
will indicate when compilation was really done.
</p>
<p id="13">
<b>Advanced explanation</b>: The actual requirement is for particular
compiler switches to be enabled when the tested code is compiled.
This is done automatically when using IDE commands while the Stepper
Dialog is present, but you could alternately manage the compiler
switch variables yourself.  All of the needed switches will be true if
the general debug optimization level is 3, as with <code>(declaim
(optimize (debug 3)))</code>.  The individual switch variables
include <a href="../variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a> for
source-level stepping, along with <a href="../variables/compiler/save-arglist-switch.htm"><code>save-arglist-switch</code></a>, <a href="../variables/compiler/save-local-names-switch.htm"><code>save-local-names-switch</code></a>, and
<a href="../variables/compiler/save-local-scopes-switch.htm"><code>save-local-scopes-switch</code></a>
in order to display local variable names and whether each variable is
currently "dead" and so on.
</p>
</li>
<li id="14">
<b>Add breakpoints to one or more functions</b> or methods by using
the <a href="run-menu.htm#set-breakpoint">Run | Set Breakpoint</a> menu command. To
do this, first place the text cursor onto the name of a function in
the editor (or elsewhere in the IDE) and then invoke the menu command.
A message in the status bar at the bottom of the IDE will mention that
a breakpoint has been added.  The keyboard shortcut for the command is
F7, so you could for example begin typing a call to a test function in
the Debug Window, pressing F7 just after typing the name of the
function to breakpoint it, and then typing the rest of the expression
and evaluating it.
<p id="15">
If the selected function name is a generic function, then a pop-up
menu will appear where you can select the particular method to
breakpoint.  The special <b>All</b> choice at the top of the menu will
breakpoint all methods.  Another way to breakpoint a particular method
is to use the Definitions dialog on a generic function, then select
one of its methods in the dialog's list and
invoke <a href="run-menu.htm#set-breakpoint">Run | Set Breakpoint</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="16">
<b>With the Stepper Dialog still present, run some test code that
calls one of the breakpointed functions</b>.  A break should occur and
bring the stepper dialog to the front with information about the
function. You are now ready to step through the definition that is
shown, as described below.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="17">
Doing the Actual Stepping
</h2>
<p id="18">
After the setup above, if you see the Stepper Dialog with a lisp form
in the second pane from the top, then you have successfully initiated
source-level stepping, and can proceed stepping through the definition
that's shown. If you instead see an assembly language form in the
second pane, then review the instructions above for setting up
source-level stepping.
</p>
<p id="19">
The three content panes are unlabeled to save space, due to the
typically large amount of content. Here are brief descriptions for
now: The uppermost pane of the dialog (the <b>Definition Pane</b>)
shows the entire definition that is being stepped through.  The second
pane from the top (the <b>Form Pane</b>) shows the form at which the
stepper is currently stopped.  The third pane (the <b>Stack Pane</b>)
shows the arguments and local variables of the function that is being
stepped through.
</p>
<p id="20">
Here is the general procedure for stepping through code:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="21">
Step through the displayed function by pressing any of the four
buttons at the lower left of the Stepper Dialog (inside the Step box),
such as the <b>Next</b> button to "step to the next form".  For
stepping quickly, it's handy to use the keyboard shortcuts for the
buttons, such as alt-N to Step Next.
</li>
<li id="22">
The Step <b>Next</b> button will proceed to execute the form that is
currently displayed in the Form Pane (and usually highlighted in the
Definition Pane), and then stop at the next form in the definition
that is currently being stepped through.  (The "next" form may
actually be a form that contains the previous form, for example.)
</li>
<li id="23">
The Step <b>Into</b> button will be available only when the
highlighted form is a function call. It will step into the function
that is called by the highlighted form, and then stop at the first
form in that function. The new function will then be displayed in the
Definition Pane, replacing the one that you were stepping through.
You can then proceed to step through the new function. On returning
from the inner function, the Stepper Dialog will continue stepping
through the outer function.
<p id="24">
Step Into is most suitable when the highlighted form in the Definition
Pane has a green background, which means that the necessary debugging
information is available for source-level stepping through the
function that will be called.
</p>
</li>
<li id="25">
The <b>Return</b> button will proceed to execute the displayed
function or method without further incremental stops, allowing it to
return normally. If the current function was called by another
function that was also being stepped, then stepping will then continue
through the calling function.
</li>
<li id="26">
The <b>Continue</b> button will proceed with normal code execution,
allowing it to complete.  This is recommended whenever you're done
stepping for now; otherwise the listener process will remain stopped
at a step, which might interfere with other IDE commands.  For
example, while stopped at a step, the <a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Tools | Incremental
Evaluation</a> command would queue up the new evaluation as usual
until the current one has returned, and it may not be clear why the
evaluation is not being done. The listener itself may be unresponsive
while stopped at a step, unless you generate a fresh prompt with <a href="view-menu.htm#debug-window">View |
Debug Window</a> menu command (the keyboard shortcut is F9).
<p id="27">
<b>Clarification</b>: The bullets above for the four stepping buttons
describe how the stepper will stop at "temporary breakpoints" that the
stepper sets itself.  In addition, the stepper will <b>always</b> stop
at "user breakpoints" that you have set yourself (until you disable or
delete the breakpoints).  So you may need to use the <b>Continue</b>
button a number of times to stop at all user breakpoints before
stepping finally completes. Or to exit all stepping as quickly as
possible, use <a href="run-menu.htm#remove-all-breakpoints">Run | Remove All Breakpoints</a> and
then press the <b>Continue</b> button a single time.
</p>
</li>
<li id="28">
In addition to setting breakpoints at the entrance to functions by
using <a href="run-menu.htm#set-breakpoint">Run | Set Breakpoint</a>, you can set
breakpoints inside the function that is being stepped through now.  To
do this, move the mouse over the Definition Pane to highlight the
breakpointable forms in the definition.  When the desired form is
highlighted with a blue border, left-click to breakpoint that form.
The parentheses on the ends of the form will turn red to indicate that
there is a breakpoint on that form.  Left-clicking a form that is
already breakpointed will unbreakpoint that form.  Or right-click the
form and select "Breakpoint" or "Unbreakpoint" from the pop-up menu
that appears.
<p id="29">
It can be useful to add a breakpoint somewhere past the highlighted
form in the Definition Pane, and then to press the Continue button to
proceed to that point.  That's faster than stopping at all of the
forms in between.
</p>

<p id="30">
You can set breakpoints inside a definition without first
breakpointing the entrance to the function by using 
<a href="run-menu.htm#show-def-stepper-dialog">Run | Show Definition in Stepper
Dialog</a>. That command will display a definition in the 
<a href="stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper Dialog</a>
even though it is not being executed and stepped through (assuming
that the function has been compiled for source-level debugging --
see <a href="../debugging.htm#source-step-1">The source
stepper</a> in <a href="../debugging.htm">debugging.htm</a>). You can then
set breakpoints inside the definition before running code that will
call the function and stop at those breakpoints.
</p>

</li>
<li id="31">
<b>When doing a step results in all of the stepper dialog panes
turning blank and remaining so</b>, it means that the evaluation has
proceded without hitting another breakpoint.  The code execution might
be busy, but typically it will have completed.  If the current test
was initiated by evaluating a form in a listener or in the editor, you
may want to check the listener at this time to see what final values
were returned.
</li>
<li id="32">
If you come to a place where you would like to edit the real source
code, such as to fix a bug, then press the <b>Edit</b> button to show
the displayed function or method in the IDE's source code editor.  The
code at the current step will be selected in the editor just as it is
in the Definition Pane, and the selection will be updated in the
editor during further stepping as long as that editor pane is left
open.
</li>
<li id="33">
If you would like to temporarily execute the test code normally
without interruption, toggle the Breakpoints Enabled check box off to
disable the currently defined breakpoints.  Toggle it back on later to
for another stepping test.  If you toggle the check box off while
stopped at a step, it will abort from the evaluation that is being
stepped through.  <b>Note</b>: Toggling the Breakpoints Enabled
check-box while stopped at a step may not be working properly at this
time, and may lead to a confused state.
</li>
<li id="34">
<b>When you are done stepping for the moment</b>, it is recommended
that you press the <b>Continue</b> button a number of times as needed
until all stepping has completed, to let the process unwind from the
code that was being stepped through.  Once that has happened, toggling
off the <b>Breakpoints Enabled</b> check box will avoid triggering the
still-active breakpoints for now.  And when you are completely done
testing the current set of breakpoints, <a href="run-menu.htm#remove-all-breakpoints">Run | Remove All
Breakpoints</a> will delete all user breakpoints.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="35">
The Definition Pane
</h2>
<p id="36">
The Definition Pane (at the top of the dialog) shows the source code
for the function or method that's currently being stepped through.
This is a copy of the real source code text, complete with comments
and original line breaks.  The form at which the stepper is currently
stopped will be highlighted with a different background color.  The
meaning of the various colors is covered in a separate section below.
Red parentheses are drawn around any breakpointed forms.
</p>
<p id="37">
The breakpointable form under the mouse (if any) in the Definition
Pane will have a blue border drawn around it; this is the "selected
object" in the pane to which commands on the right-button shortcut
menu will be applied.  Even keyboard shortcuts from the IDE's menu bar
can be applied to the highlighted form.  If the mouse is not inside
the Definition Pane, then the form at which the stepper is stopped is
the selected object to which IDE commands will be applied.
</p>
<h2 id="38">
The Form Pane
</h2>
<p id="39">
The Form Pane (second from the top) shows just the form at which the
stepper is currently stopped.  This form would be executed by a
subsequent Step Next.  Sometimes this is a form in the original source
code, and is the same as the highlighted form in the Definition Pane,
and at other times it is all or part of a macroexpansion.  This form
is shown pretty-printed by the lisp printer, and therefore is
typically more compact than the highlighted form in the Definition
Pane even when they are the same form.  You could click on a symbol in
this pane and then apply IDE menu bar commands to it, for example, as
in the editor.
</p>
<h2 id="40">
The Stack Pane
</h2>
<p id="41">
The Stack Pane (third from the top) lists the arguments and local
variables of the function that is being stepped through, followed by
the arguments to the function that called the function being stepped,
and then by the arguments to the next calling function.  When a new
function is first stepped into, the arguments are listed first,
whereas on subsequent steps the local variables are listed first; this
is done so that the most pertinent information at each step is more
likely to be visible when the Stack Pane remains scrolled to the top.
</p>
<p id="42">
Whenever the value of a local variable changes during stepping, the
new value will appear in this list immediately.  A new variable value
(and the variable name) will be shown in red text, with the previous
value displayed beside it in parentheses, and the variable will be
scrolled into view automatically.  (When multiple variables have
changed, only the first one may be scrolled into view.)
</p>
<p id="43">
A new variable value will not be updated in this list if it is being
held in a register for efficiency, rather than being stored in the
variable's official location on the stack.  You may see it updated
here later if the new value is eventually moved to the stack, perhaps
when the value is actually used.
</p>
<p id="44">
You can click on a line of text in the Stack Pane (third from the top)
to select the value of an argument or local variable.  Then (as usual
in the IDE) you can invoke any command on the IDE's menu bar on the
selected argument or variable value; this will do something if that
command makes sense on that kind of value.  Or right-click a value to
see a pop-up menu of suggested commands for that kind of value.  Or
double-click a value to inspect it in the IDE's Inspector.
</p>

<p id="45">
As a debugging experiment, you can modify the value of an argument or
local variable at any step, and then continue stepping with the
replacement value.  To do this, right-click the desired argument or
variable and select <b>Modify Argument or Variable</b> from the
pop-up menu.  A modal dialog will then appear, where you can enter a
lisp expression that will be evaluated to produce a replacement value
for that argument or variable.  You can then continue execution with
the replacement value.
</p>

<p id="46">
When the Include <b>Dead Locals</b> check box is checked, as it is by
default, then the Stack Pane displays all local variables.  When it is
unchecked, variables that are "dead" at the current step are excluded
from the list.  A dead variable is one whose current value will no
longer be used as the execution of the current function proceeds
(though it may later be set to another value that will be used).
</p>
<h2 id="47">
The Highlighting Colors in the Definition Pane
</h2>
<p id="48">
The form in the Definition Pane at which the stepper is currently
stopped is drawn with a background color that can have different
meanings.  An explanatory note will appear in the dialog the first
three times each highlighting color is used.
</p>
<p id="49">
When the highlighting is blue, this is simply the default highlighting
color that is used when none of the special colors below are in
effect.
</p>
<p id="50">
When the highlighting is green, it means that source-level debugging
information is available for the function that the highlighted form
will call.  This is a "green light" that pressing the Step Into button
will continue doing source-level stepping.  The called function would
then replace the calling function in the Definition Pane.
</p>

<p id="51">
When the highlighting is yellow, it means that you can do a <b>Step
Into</b> to step through the function that is being called on that
step, though no source debug info is known for the function that is
being entered and so it will be stepped through at the assembly
language level.  So this is a yellow light to do a <b>Step Into</b>
with caution.  When that function call returns, the stepper should
resume stepping that current function at the source code level.
</p>

<p id="52">
When the highlighting is orange, it means that you are stopped at a
macro form.  The next step may be affected by the current choice in
the <b>Macroexpansion Stepping Action</b> group at the lower right of
the stepper dialog.  See the notes that are shown in the dialog's
status bar as you move the mouse over those choices.
</p>
<p id="53">
When the highlighting is gray, it means that no source code range is
known for the current step point.  The previously-highlighted form
remains highlighted simply as a general landmark.  Typically the
higlighted code will be a macro form that you are still somewhere
inside, but execution may actually be at some point beyond the gray
highlighted form.
</p>

<p id="54">
When the highlighting is purple, the highlighted form is a preview of
a function call that will be made later, after its arguments are
evaluated. To step into that function, you would first need to do
more <b>Next</b> steps to evaluate the arguments. When the
highlighting returns to this same form just before the call is really
about to be made, it will be green or yellow to show that you can step
into the function at that time.
</p>

<h2 id="55">
Scrolling the Three Content Panes
</h2>
<p id="56">
Whenever the <b>Definition Pane</b> at the top has the keyboard focus,
each of the three panes that display information may be scrolled with
the keyboard using the usual vertical scrolling keys (PageUp and
PageDown, Home and End, and the up and down arrow keys).  If no shift
keys are held down, then the Definition Pane is scrolled.  If the
shift key is held down, the Form Pane is scrolled, and if the control
key is held down, the Stack Pane is scrolled.
</p>
<p id="57">
Whenever execution stops at a step and the Stepper Dialog is selected,
the keyboard focus is moved to the <b>Definition Pane</b> to
facilitate scrolling the three content panes in this way.
</p>
<h2 id="58">
Text Search
</h2>
<p id="59">
When either the <b>Definition Pane</b> or the <b>Stack Pane</b> has
the keyboard focus, <a href="search-menu.htm#find-forward">Search | Find Forward</a> (from the IDE's menu bar)
can be used to search the pane for an arbitrary string, and then
<a href="search-menu.htm#find-again">Search | Find Again</a> may be used to find
subsequent matches.
</p>
<p id="60">
In the Definition Pane, <a href="search-menu.htm#find-forward">Search | Find Forward</a> will always start at the
top of the definition.  A string match will be highlighted with a
light red background.
</p>
<p id="61">
In the Stack Pane, <a href="search-menu.htm#find-forward">Search | Find Forward</a> will always start at
the top of the list. Only variable names are searched for string
matches. A line with a matching variable name will be selected.
</p>
<p id="62">
Pressing the Tab key in either of these panes will move the keyboard
focus to the other pane. A vertical gray bar is drawn just inside
either of these pane's scrollbar when it has the focus.

</p>
<h2 id="63">
Assembly-Language Stepping in the Stepper Dialog
</h2>
<p id="64">
If breakpoints are added to functions for which source-level debugging
information is not available, and the Stepper Dialog is present when
the breakpoints are hit, the Stepper dialog will still display some
information and allow stepping to be done. The <b>Definition Pane</b>
will still display the function source if the usual "source file
information" is available, but will not highlight forms for the
current step because they are not known.  The <b>Form Pane</b> will
display an assembly language form rather than a lisp form. And the
<b>Stack Pane</b> will still display local variable values.
</p>
<h2 id="65">
The Preferred Language Combo Box
</h2>
<p id="66">
The <b>Preferred Language Combo Box</b> can be used to specify the
language in which you would like to do stepping. The default setting
is <b>No Preferred Language</b>, which will map to the highest-level
language that pertains to the code being stepped. If you
select <b>Asm</b>, then stepping will be performed at the assembly
language level even where lisp source-level information is available.
(Stepping through other languages such as Python may be possible in
the future.)
</p>
<p id="67">
When changing this setting, existing breakpoints will still be stepped
in the language that was current when those breakpoints were added.
You would need to delete and re-add those breakpoints to use them with
the newly-selected language.
</p>
<h2 id="68">
Macroexpansion Stepping Action radio buttons
</h2>

<p id="69">
The <b>Macroexpansion Stepping Actions</b> radio buttons at the lower
right specify what action to take when encountering a macro form. The
choices are
</p>
<ul>
<li id="70">
<b>Over</b>: step over this form or macroexpansion and to the next form.
</li>
<li id="71">
<b>Across</b>: step across the top levels of the current form.
</li>
<li id="72">
<b>Into</b>: expand macros.
</li>
<li id="73">
<b>Out</b>: step until the next outer macroexpansion is re-entered.
</li>

<li id="74">
<b>Max-Level</b>: a variant of <b>:into</b> which allows specifying
how many levels of macroexpansion will be done. Further macro forms
encountered will be stepped over and breakpoints in their
macroexpansion will not be seen.
</li>

</ul>
<p id="75">
Running the mouse cursor ove rthe choices displays documentation in
the dialog status bar at the bottom of the dialog. The top-level
command <b>:help step</b> typed to a Listener prompt will also provide
documentation.
</p>

<h2 id="76">
Stretching the Content Panes
</h2>
<p id="77">
The dialog has two <a href="../classes/cg/split-bar.htm"><code>split-bar</code></a> widgets for adjusting the relative
size of the three content panes. When the resizing mouse cursor
appears as you move the mouse between the panes, click and drag to
adjust the sizes.
