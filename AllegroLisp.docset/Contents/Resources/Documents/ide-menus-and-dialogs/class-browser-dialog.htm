<p id="3"><img src="../pictures/class-br.jpg"></p>

<p id="4">
The class browser displays a graphical outline of the class structure
(focusing on the specific named class). Information about the selected
class is shown in the  pane on the
right.
</p>

<p id="5">
The outline (which is an instance of an <a href="../classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> widget) can be navigated quickly by
pressing the J, K, F, and D keys as alternatives to the down, up,
right, and left arrow keys respectively, and the T and B keys for the
Home and End keys. This works because the outline widgets in IDE tool
dialogs enable their <a href="../operators/cg/h/handle-home-key-shortcuts.htm"><b>handle-home-key-shortcuts</b></a> property.
</p>

<p id="6">
The browser is displayed when <a href="tools-menu.htm#browse-class">Tools | Browse Class</a> is
clicked. If there is a selected symbol naming a class (or if the
cursor is in or next to text naming a symbol naming a class), that
class is selected in the browser. Otherwise, the previously selected
class or <code>t</code> are browsed but you can enter a
class name in the Name field to browse a different class. In the
illustration, we are browsing the class <code>integer</code>.
</p>
<p id="7">
When a class outline is generated for a class, that class is initially
selected in the outline (as <code>integer</code> is in the
illustration), but you can then click on other classes in the outline
(or use the arrow keys as usual) to display information about related
classes. When this is done, the class for which the outline was
generated will be highlighted in the outline with a light blue
background, while the selected class in the outline (for which
information is displayed in the 
pane) will always be highlighted with the usual selection
background color that you have set up in the Windows Control Panel.
</p>
<p id="8">
Pressing the main ENTER key while the outline widget has the keyboard
focus will generate a new class outline for the class that is
currently selected there, just as if the <a href="tools-menu.htm#browse-class">Tools |
Browse Class</a> command had been invoked on that class
name. Right-clicking the outline will pop-up a shortcut menu of
several commands from the IDE menu-bar that are likely useful for the
selected class (this right-click does not select a class though), and
other IDE menu-bar commands may be applicable as well.
</p>



<p id="9">
The information displayed in the pane on the right depends on which of
the Feature toolbar icons is slected. Positioning the mouse over an
icon will display a tooltip naming the icon (we use those names in the
description below). The first seven refer to any class and the last
two (<b>P</b> and <b>E</b> for Properties and Events) apply to Common
Graphics-related classes.
</p>
<p id="10">
The first three choices list classes that are related to the selected
class. Double-clicking or pressing ENTER on one of these classes will
generate a new class outline for that class.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="11">
<b>Direct Superclasses</b> lists the immediate superclasses of the
selected class, as returned by <b>mop:class-direct-superclasses</b>.
</li>
<li id="12">
<b>DirectSubclasses</b> lists the immediate subclasses of the selected
class, as returned by <b>mop:class-direct-subclasses</b>.
</li>
<li id="13">
<b>Class Precedence</b> lists all of the superclasses of the selected class,
as returned by <b>mop:class-precedence-list</b>. The precedence order
determines which methods get called, and in what order, when a generic
function is called on this class.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="14">
The next two choices list slots of the selected class.  Double-clicking or
pressing ENTER on one of these slots will inspect the slot definition
object.  Simply selecting a slot will cause any classes that are
visible in the class outline and which define a slot with that name to
be highlighted with a light red background; this feature can be used
to find out where an inherited slot is inherited from, and the <a href="search-menu.htm#quick-find-definition">Search | Quick Find Definition</a>
command can then be used to edit the code that defines the slot.  (The
single selected class in the outline will always have its usual
highlighting, and so will not show this special red highlighting.)
</p>
<ul>
<li id="15">
<b>Direct Slots</b> lists the slots that are defined by the selected class,
as returned by <b>mop:class-direct-slots</b>. The slots are shown in
alphabetical order, rather than the order in which they are defined on
the class.
</li>
<li id="16">
<b>All Slots</b> lists both the slots defined by the selected class as
well as any slots that this class inherits from superclasses, as
returned by <b>mop:class-slots</b>.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="17">
The next two choices list methods of the selected class.  Double-clicking
or pressing ENTER on one of these methods invokes the IDE editor on
that method (if the location of its source code is known).  Invoking
the <a href="run-menu.htm#trace">Run |
Trace</a> command will trace just the selected method, rather
than its generic function. Invoking the <a href="edit-menu.htm#delete">Edit | Delete</a>
command will offer to remove the selected method from your lisp
environment.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="18">
<b>Methods</b> lists all methods that specialize on the selected class
itself, as returned by <b>mop:specializer-direct-methods</b>.
</li>
<li id="19">
<b>All Methods</b> lists all methods that specialize on the selected class
or on any of its superclasses below standard-class or structure-class.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="20">
The final two choices display the properties of the selected class.
In the illustration, we the <a href="../classes/cg/combo-box.htm"><code>combo-box</code></a> class is selected and its properties
are listed.
</p>
<p id="21"><img src="../pictures/class-br-cb-prop.jpg"></p>

<p id="22">
These choices are enabled appear only if properties have been defined
for the class by calling <a href="../operators/cg/d/defproperties.htm"><b>defproperties</b></a> or <a href="../operators/cg/d/defcomponent.htm"><b>defcomponent</b></a> (only certain CG and IDE classes
initially). Double-clicking or pressing ENTER on one of these
properties will inspect the property; this may be useful for finding
the names of the property-reader or property-writer functions for the
property in the rare cases where these are not <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/equal.htm"><b>equal</b></a> to the property name itself (and its
setf).
</p>
<ul>
<li id="23">
<b>Properties</b> lists all non-event-handler properties of the
selected class, as returned by <a href="../operators/cg/n/non-event-properties.htm"><b>non-event-properties</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="24">
<b>Events</b> lists all event-handler properties of the selected
class, as returned by <a href="../operators/cg/e/event-handlers.htm"><b>event-handlers</b></a>.
</li>
</ul>
