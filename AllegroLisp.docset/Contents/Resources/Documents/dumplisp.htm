<p id="5">
The function <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> writes
an image file from the current running Lisp image. It has many options
and many uses. Unlike the two other functions that create new images,
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>
and <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> preserves much of the environment of
the running image. Both <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> create new images from
external constituent parts that inherit nothing from the running
image.
</p>
<p id="6">
If you are building images for general use (for example, an image
incorporating an application), we recommend that you
use <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>
or <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>
rather than <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> as
those functions give more control over the resulting images and
unnecessary functionality which may be in your running image will not
be included.
</p>

<p id="7">
A new <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> feature on
Windows only (added by a post-9.0 patch) allows for what is
essentially a pseudo-fork operation on Windows and is useful for very
large images. See <a href="#pseudo-fork-1">Section 22.0 Virtual dumplisp: for very large images and pseudo-forks on Windows</a> for
more details.

<hr><hr><h2 id="8"><a name="finding-files-1">2.0 Finding additional files</a></h2>

<p id="9">
One advantage of the small executable/large image model is that all
image files use the same executable, so there needs only be one
executable file on a machine (or on a network). This means that the
location of that executable can be used as a starting location which
can be a reference point for finding other necessary files.
</p>

<p id="10">
The location of the executable is taken as the reference point for
finding files so no specific location must be supplied when Lisp
starts up. (You can specify a different location with the -H argument
if you wish. However, that should not be necessary.)
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="11"><a name="dumplisp-uses-1">3.0 Uses of excl:dumplisp</a></h2>

<p id="12">
You might use <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> for the following purposes (as
well as others not listed): 
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="13">Saving certain parts of the state of a running image. <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> cannot save the
    entire state.  Thus processes cannot be saved (neither their state
    nor even the fact that they were running) nor can OS connections
    such as open files and databases, but other things, like variable
    values, function definitions, macro definitions etc. are all
    saved.</li> 
    <li id="14">Customizing an image. You may dump an image after,
    for example, loading a large application (which you intend to use
    yourself). Then you do not have to spend time loading the
    application each time you start Lisp. You can also dump an image
    after defining functions and setting variables to your liking, but
    simple things like that are usually better done with
    initialization files (like ~/.clinit.cl). See 
    <a href="#creating-a-custom-image-1">Section 8.0 Creating a customized image</a> below.</li> 
    <li id="15">Preparing an application for
    delivery. We generally recommend using excl:generate-application
    for this purpose but <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> can be used as well. The
    dumped image may be intended for delivery to others (perhaps at
    different sites or running on different networks). See 
    <a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a> where delivery issues are
    discussed in greater detail. Note that you must have the correct
    license before you can ship an image of any sort away from your
    site. Please contact the correct administrator at your site or
    your Franz Inc. account manager if you have questions about what
    you are licensed to do with dumped images.</li>
</ul>

<p id="34">When a Lisp Listener (which presents the prompt to users and

many Common Lisp and Allegro CL-specific global variables. The

the listener when the dumped image is started, you must modify the
appropriate alist. The easiest way to do this is with <a href="operators/tpl/setq-default.htm"><b>tpl:setq-default</b></a>.  This macro
is like <b>setq</b>: its first argument should be a symbol and is not

<p id="58">This issue is also discussed in <a href="eli.htm">eli.htm</a>. The
Emacs-Lisp interface provides a close coupling of Allegro CL and
Emacs. What is important with respect to dumped images is how the
interface is started. It can only be started by invoking Allegro CL
within Emacs with the function <strong>fi:common-lisp</strong>. Images
invoked in that way cause the Emacs-Lisp interface to be started with
the command line arguments "-e (excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface
t)" (plus any additional command line arguments you
specify). This will be ineffective if processing of those command line
arguments is suppressed because the image was dumped with the
<i>ignore-command-line-arguments</i> argument to <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> specified true.</p>

<p id="59">If you create an image which ignores command-line arguments and you
want the emacs-lisp interface started, you must take responsibility
for evaluating <code>(<b>excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface</b>
t)</code>. This could be done as part of the <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a>.</p>

<p id="60">There is one minor complication: you may want to handle the case
where you are starting the image in some fashion other than calling
fi:common-lisp within Emacs (for example, starting Lisp in a
shell). In that case, calling
<b>excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface</b> will not, of course, do
anything effective. Calling the function is not an error. However, it
does print a cryptic string to the listener, which you may want to
avoid. The solution to that problem is, instead of unconditionally
calling <b>excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface</b>, to look yourself
for "-e (excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface t)" among the
command line arguments and only call
<b>excl::new-start-emacs-lisp-interface</b> if it appears. The
following code (which actually simply looks for the first -e argument
and evaluates its companion argument) will do that:</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="64"><a name="standalone-images-1">16.0 Standalone image: not supported</a></h2>

<p id="65">Because Allegro CL now requires an executable file and an image
file, standalone images (images that depend on no other files) are no
longer possible.</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="66"><a name="library-files-1">17.0 How the dumped image finds loaded library files</a></h2>

<p id="67">Foreign loading is done on Unix by `loading' <i>.so</i> or
<i>.sl</i> files with dlopen() or an equivalent and on Windows by
loading <i>.dll</i> files. Dumped images must find these files when it
starts up. </p>

<p id="68">The pathnames of loaded .so files are stored. So long as those
pathnames are valid when the image is restarted, things should work
correctly. However, to guarantee that the dumped image finds the .so
files when it restarts, even if run on a different machine or network,
you can use one of the following methods. </p>

<ol>
  <li id="69">Use pathnames that will be valid when the dumped image restarts 
    (and, as we describe,
    logical pathnames can be made valid in the dumped image); or </li>
  <li id="70">Unload the .so files prior to dumplisp and reload them as part of the startup procedure
    (perhaps as an action taken by <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a>).
    We describe both methods in some detail.</li>
</ol>

<p id="71"><strong>Using logical pathnames and making them valid in the dumped
image</strong>. Lisp stores the pathnames of all loaded .so files as
they are specified to load (or <a href="tpl-commands/ld.htm"><b>:ld</b></a>). It uses these stored pathnames when
a dumped image is restarted to find the files and reload them. We
recommend these steps for loading .so files. Because logical pathnames
are used and because a translations file is specified
(<i>~/myhosts</i>), all that is needed is to ensure that file contains
the correct translation for the logical host. </p>

<ol>
  <li id="72">Specify the needed files to be loaded with logical pathnames.</li>
  <li id="73">Modify <a href="operators/excl/logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames.htm"><b>logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames</b></a>
    before dumping the image so that some file under your control (~/myhosts, e.g.) is
    examined along with <em>sys:hosts.cl</em>.</li>
  <li id="74">Make sure that file has the correct translation for the logical pathnames used to
    identify the .so files.</li>
</ol>

<p id="75">For example, suppose you want to load
/<em>usr/mydir/mysos/foo.so</em> into an image that will be
dumped. The following transcript shows the actions in the pre-dumped
image and modifications to the external logical hosts file.</p>

<pre id="76">

           '((";**;*.*"

<ol>
  <li id="80">Certain Allegro CL utilities may dynamically load .so
    files. (CLIM does if loading into a running image rather than
    being built into the image, e.g.). These files are specified with
    logical pathnames with host <i>sys:</i>, so they should be found
    without programmer intervention.</li>

  <li id="81">The <a href="variables/excl/s_restart-init-function_s.htm"><code>*restart-init-function*</code></a> in our example is
    very simple and not very useful. In real situations, programmers
    would likely get information from a command-line argument or an
    initialization file about the location of the needed files and act
    on that information.</li>

  <li id="82">The files must be found and reloaded before any foreign function
    that requires them is called.</li>
</ol>

<hr><hr><h2 id="83"><a name="logical-pathnames-1">18.0 Logical pathnames and the dumped image</a></h2>

<p id="84">All logical pathname translations are flushed as the first action
when a dumped image restarts. This is a feature. There is no way for
Lisp to tell whether the translations are valid upon restart (and they
almost certainly will not be valid if the image is restarted on a
different machine on a different network). Rather than devise a way to
communicate to Lisp whether to flush translations on startup (and thus
overload the few ways available to communicate with restarting
images), Allegro CL instead provides tools for properly
re-establishing translations using specific files.</p>

<p id="85">The function <a href="operators/excl/logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames.htm"><b>logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames</b></a>
returns a list of pathname namestrings. Initially, it returns the list
("sys:hosts.cl"). You may use <b>push</b> or <b>pushnew</b>
to add other strings naming files. For example,</p>

<pre id="86">
USER(5): (logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames)
("sys:hosts.cl")
USER(6): (pushnew "~/myhosts"
(logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames))
("~/myhosts" "sys:hosts.cl")
USER(6): (logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames)
("~/myhosts" "sys:hosts.cl")
</pre>

<p id="87">When looking for a translation for a logical pathname, Lisp will
look first in <i>~/myhosts</i> and then in <i>sys:hosts.cl</i>. It is
not an error if a named file does not exist.  Therefore, your
translations should be added to <i>hosts.cl</i> in the Allegro
directory or to a file of your own which you push onto <a href="operators/excl/logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames.htm"><b>logical-pathname-translations-database-pathnames</b></a>
as described above. (Many users of Lisp may not have permission to
modify <i>hosts.cl</i>.  Indeed, having several users modifying that
file is impractical.)</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="88"><a name="allegro-directory-1">19.0 How the dumped image finds its Allegro directory</a></h2>

<p id="89">
The Allegro directory is the location of the executable file (such
as <em>mlisp</em> or <em>mlisp.exe</em>). In the separate
executable/image model, finding the directory using the executable is
simple and should work without problems.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="90"><a name="multiprocessing-1">20.0 dumplisp and multiprocessing</a></h2>

<p id="91">
When lisp starts from a dumped image, it has exactly one process that
is runnable, the <b>Initial Lisp Listener</b> process, and that is a
new process, completely unrelated to the Initial Lisp Listener process
that was running when the image was dumped.
</p>
<p id="92">
Any other processes that were in the image when it was dumped must be
<a href="operators/mp/process-reset.htm"><b>process-reset</b></a>
before being run again. It would be legal to <a href="operators/mp/process-kill.htm"><b>process-kill</b></a> any or all of them
instead of resetting and restarting them.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="93"><a name="using-dumped-image-1">21.0 How to use the dumped image</a></h2>

<p id="94">
The image is specified to the executable with the -I argument, Thus,
if the dumped image is named <i>myimage.dxl</i>, and mlisp.exe or
mlisp is the executable, then this starts a Lisp using
<i>myimage.dxl</i>:
</p>

<pre id="95">
[Windows]
% mlisp.exe [+ args if any] -I &lt;path&gt;/myimage.dxl [other args]
[Unix]
% mlisp -I &lt;path&gt;/myimage.dxl [other args]
</pre>

<p id="96">
If no -I argument is specified, the executable looks for an image
in the same directory with the same name as itself (thus
<em>mlisp.exe</em> will look for <em>mlisp.dxl</em>). If you have
created an image for general use, you may wish to copy it to the
Allegro directory (assuming you have permission to do so) and copy the
executable to have the same name.

<hr><hr><h2 id="97"><a name="pseudo-fork-1">22.0 Virtual dumplisp: for very large images and pseudo-forks on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="98">
<a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> on Windows only
recognizes a new keyword
argument <b><i>virtual</i></b>. If specified
and non-<code>nil</code>, it requests <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> to create a two-piece lisp image. The
file named by the name keyword argument will be one piece and will be
relatively small. Most of the dumped image will be in the second
piece, a memory-mapped virtual file. The real file contains a
reference to the virtual file.
</p>
<h3 id="99">
Example:
</h3>
<pre id="100">
   (dumplisp :name "vapp.dxl" :virtual t)
</pre>

<p id="101">
will write a relatively small file named vapp.dxl and create a large
virtual file holding most of the image data. <b>vapp.dxl</b> will have a
symbolic pointer to the virtual file. As long as the virtual file
exists, executing the shell command
</p>

<pre id="102">
    lisp -I vapp
</pre>

<p id="103">
will get its image data from the virtual file.
</p>
<p id="104">
One important issue is "How long does that virtual file exist"? The
answer is that it exists as long as there is a Lisp program using it.
The Lisp program that did the virtual dumplisp is a initially the only
user. When it exits, it will no longer be a user, obviously, and the
virtual data will vanish unless there is another user. A Lisp that is
loading data from a virtual image by copying it is a user as long as
it is loading the data. Once the data has been copied, that Lisp
program is no longer a user. A Lisp program that maps the data rather
than copying it will be a user until it exits.
</p>
<p id="105">
A Lisp program that creates a virtual image file can release the
virtual file before exiting, and may wish to do so to release the OS
resources dedicated to supporting the virtual file. To do so it must
capture the result returned from dumplisp and then call
<a href="operators/excl/release-dumplisp-virtual-image.htm"><b>excl:release-dumplisp-virtual-image</b></a> when it
wishes to discard the file.
</p>
<p id="106">
<a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> returns no values
when it is called with <code>:virtual nil</code> or
unspecified. When called with <code>:virtual</code>
non-<code>nil</code>, <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> returns a value that can later be
used to release the virtual file. One usage pattern would be something
like this:
</p>

<pre id="107">
(let ((vmem (dumplisp :name "vapp.dxl" :virtual t)))
  (run-shell-command "lisp -I vapp.dxl -- initial")
  (run-shell-command "lisp -I vapp.dcl -- cleanup")
  (excl:release-dumplisp-virtual-image vmem))
</pre>

<p id="108">
This runs one Lisp from the image with initial as a command line
argument, then when that one finishes it runs another with command
line argument cleanup. Then it releases the virtual image file.
</p>
<p id="109">
Virtual image files are only available on Windows; requesting a
virtual image file on a non-Windows lisp results in a warning and an
ordinary file-based <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="110">
Once a virtual image file has been released, the file part of the
dumplisp that references it is no longer a valid image file for
starting lisps. An attempt to use it will result in an error.
</p>
<p id="111">
Calling <a href="operators/excl/release-dumplisp-virtual-image.htm"><b>excl:release-dumplisp-virtual-image</b></a> a
second time on the same otherwise legitimate argument is legal and
does nothing.
</p>
<p id="112">
Calling <a href="operators/excl/release-dumplisp-virtual-image.htm"><b>excl:release-dumplisp-virtual-image</b></a> with an
argument that was not previously returned by <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a> is an error that may or may
not be recognized and signaled.
